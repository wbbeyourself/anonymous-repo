    "paragraph": "\nTitle:      Gone With The Wind\nAuthor:     Margaret Mitchell (1900-1949)\n\n\nPART ONE\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nScarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it when\ncaught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were.  In her face were\ntoo sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a Coast\naristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid\nIrish father.  But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin,\nsquare of jaw.  Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel,\nstarred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends.\nAbove them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a\nstartling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin--that skin so\nprized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets,\nveils and mittens against hot Georgia suns.\n\nSeated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the\nporch of Tara, her father's plantation, that bright April\nafternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture.  Her new green\nflowered-muslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing\nmaterial over her hoops and exactly matched the flat-heeled green\nmorocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta.\nThe dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist, the\nsmallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting basque showed\nbreasts well matured for her sixteen years.  But for all the\nmodesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted\nsmoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands\nfolded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed.  The green\neyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty\nwith life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor.\nHer manners had been imposed upon her by her mother's gentle\nadmonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy; her eyes were\nher own.\n\nOn either side of her, the twins lounged easily in their chairs,\nsquinting at the sunlight through tall mint-garnished glasses as\nthey laughed and talked, their long legs, booted to the knee and\nthick with saddle muscles, crossed negligently.  Nineteen years\nold, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of muscle,\nwith sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their eyes merry and\narrogant, their bodies clothed in identical blue coats and\nmustard-colored breeches, they were as much alike as two bolls of\ncotton.\n\nOutside, the late afternoon sun slanted down in the yard, throwing\ninto gleaming brightness the dogwood trees that were solid masses\nof white blossoms against the background of new green.  The twins'\nhorses were hitched in the driveway, big animals, red as their\nmasters' hair; and around the horses' legs quarreled the pack of\nlean, nervous possum hounds that accompanied Stuart and Brent\nwherever they went.  A little aloof, as became an aristocrat, lay\na black-spotted carriage dog, muzzle on paws, patiently waiting\nfor the boys to go home to supper.\n\nBetween the hounds and the horses and the twins there was a\nkinship deeper than that of their constant companionship.  They\nwere all healthy, thoughtless young animals, sleek, graceful,\nhigh-spirited, the boys as mettlesome as the horses they rode,\nmettlesome and dangerous but, withal, sweet-tempered to those who\nknew how to handle them.\n\nAlthough born to the ease of plantation life, waited on hand and\nfoot since infancy, the faces of the three on the porch were\nneither slack nor soft.  They had the vigor and alertness of\ncountry people who have spent all their lives in the open and\ntroubled their heads very little with dull things in books.  Life\nin the north Georgia county of Clayton was still new and,\naccording to the standards of Augusta, Savannah and Charleston, a\nlittle crude.  The more sedate and older sections of the South\nlooked down their noses at the up-country Georgians, but here in\nnorth Georgia, a lack of the niceties of classical education\ncarried no shame, provided a man was smart in the things that\nmattered.  And raising good cotton, riding well, shooting\nstraight, dancing lightly, squiring the ladies with elegance and\ncarrying one's liquor like a gentleman were the things that\nmattered.\n\nIn these accomplishments the twins excelled, and they were equally\noutstanding in their notorious inability to learn anything\ncontained between the covers of books.  Their family had more\nmoney, more horses, more slaves than any one else in the County,\nbut the boys had less grammar than most of their poor Cracker\nneighbors.\n\nIt was for this precise reason that Stuart and Brent were idling\non the porch of Tara this April afternoon.  They had just been\nexpelled from the University of Georgia, the fourth university\nthat had thrown them out in two years; and their older brothers,\nTom and Boyd, had come home with them, because they refused to\nremain at an institution where the twins were not welcome.  Stuart\nand Brent considered their latest expulsion a fine joke, and\nScarlett, who had not willingly opened a book since leaving the\nFayetteville Female Academy the year before, thought it just as\namusing as they did.\n\n\"I know you two don't care about being expelled, or Tom either,\"\nshe said.  \"But what about Boyd?  He's kind of set on getting an\neducation, and you two have pulled him out of the University of\nVirginia and Alabama and South Carolina and now Georgia.  He'll\nnever get finished at this rate.\"\n\n\"Oh, he can read law in Judge Parmalee's office over in\nFayetteville,\" answered Brent carelessly.  \"Besides, it don't\nmatter much.  We'd have had to come home before the term was out\nanyway.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The war, goose!  The war's going to start any day, and you don't\nsuppose any of us would stay in college with a war going on, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"You know there isn't going to be any war,\" said Scarlett, bored.\n\"It's all just talk.  Why, Ashley Wilkes and his father told Pa\njust last week that our commissioners in Washington would come\nto--to--an--amicable agreement with Mr. Lincoln about the\nConfederacy.  And anyway, the Yankees are too scared of us to\nfight.  There won't be any war, and I'm tired of hearing about\nit.\"\n\n\"Not going to be any war!\" cried the twins indignantly, as though\nthey had been defrauded.\n\n\"Why, honey, of course there's going to be a war,\" said Stuart.\n\"The Yankees may be scared of us, but after the way General\nBeauregard shelled them out of Fort Sumter day before yesterday,\nthey'll have to fight or stand branded as cowards before the whole\nworld.  Why, the Confederacy--\"\n\nScarlett made a mouth of bored impatience.\n\n\"If you say 'war' just once more, I'll go in the house and shut\nthe door.  I've never gotten so tired of any one word in my life\nas 'war,' unless it's 'secession.'  Pa talks war morning, noon and\nnight, and all the gentlemen who come to see him shout about Fort\nSumter and States' Rights and Abe Lincoln till I get so bored I\ncould scream!  And that's all the boys talk about, too, that and\ntheir old Troop.  There hasn't been any fun at any party this\nspring because the boys can't talk about anything else.  I'm\nmighty glad Georgia waited till after Christmas before it seceded\nor it would have ruined the Christmas parties, too.  If you say\n'war' again, I'll go in the house.\"\n\nShe meant what she said, for she could never long endure any\nconversation of which she was not the chief subject.  But she\nsmiled when she spoke, consciously deepening her dimple and\nfluttering her bristly black lashes as swiftly as butterflies'\nwings.  The boys were enchanted, as she had intended them to be,\nand they hastened to apologize for boring her.  They thought none\nthe less of her for her lack of interest.  Indeed, they thought\nmore.  War was men's business, not ladies', and they took her\nattitude as evidence of her femininity.\n\nHaving maneuvered them away from the boring subject of war, she\nwent back with interest to their immediate situation.\n\n\"What did your mother say about you two being expelled again?\"\n\nThe boys looked uncomfortable, recalling their mother's conduct\nthree months ago when they had come home, by request, from the\nUniversity of Virginia.\n\n\"Well,\" said Stuart, \"she hasn't had a chance to say anything yet.\nTom and us left home early this morning before she got up, and\nTom's laying out over at the Fontaines' while we came over here.\"\n\n\"Didn't she say anything when you got home last night?\"\n\n\"We were in luck last night.  Just before we got home that new\nstallion Ma got in Kentucky last month was brought in, and the\nplace was in a stew.  The big brute--he's a grand horse, Scarlett;\nyou must tell your pa to come over and see him right away--he'd\nalready bitten a hunk out of his groom on the way down here and\nhe'd trampled two of Ma's darkies who met the train at Jonesboro.\nAnd just before we got home, he'd about kicked the stable down and\nhalf-killed Strawberry, Ma's old stallion.  When we got home, Ma\nwas out in the stable with a sackful of sugar smoothing him down\nand doing it mighty well, too.  The darkies were hanging from the\nrafters, popeyed, they were so scared, but Ma was talking to the\nhorse like he was folks and he was eating out of her hand.  There\nain't nobody like Ma with a horse.  And when she saw us she said:\n'In Heaven's name, what are you four doing home again?  You're\nworse than the plagues of Egypt!'  And then the horse began\nsnorting and rearing and she said:  'Get out of here!  Can't you\nsee he's nervous, the big darling?  I'll tend to you four in the\nmorning!'  So we went to bed, and this morning we got away before\nshe could catch us and left Boyd to handle her.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose she'll hit Boyd?\"  Scarlett, like the rest of the\nCounty, could never get used to the way small Mrs. Tarleton\nbullied her grown sons and laid her riding crop on their backs if\nthe occasion seemed to warrant it.\n\nBeatrice Tarleton was a busy woman, having on her hands not only a\nlarge cotton plantation, a hundred negroes and eight children, but\nthe largest horse-breeding farm in the state as well.  She was\nhot-tempered and easily plagued by the frequent scrapes of her\nfour sons, and while no one was permitted to whip a horse or a\nslave, she felt that a lick now and then didn't do the boys any\nharm.\n\n\"Of course she won't hit Boyd.  She never did beat Boyd much\nbecause he's the oldest and besides he's the runt of the litter,\"\nsaid Stuart, proud of his six feet two.  \"That's why we left him\nat home to explain things to her.  God'lmighty, Ma ought to stop\nlicking us!  We're nineteen and Tom's twenty-one, and she acts\nlike we're six years old.\"\n\n\"Will your mother ride the new horse to the Wilkes barbecue\ntomorrow?\"\n\n\"She wants to, but Pa says he's too dangerous.  And, anyway, the\ngirls won't let her.  They said they were going to have her go to\none party at least like a lady, riding in the carriage.\"\n\n\"I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow,\" said Scarlett.  \"It's rained\nnearly every day for a week.  There's nothing worse than a\nbarbecue turned into an indoor picnic.\"\n\n\"Oh, it'll be clear tomorrow and hot as June,\" said Stuart.\n\"Look at that sunset.  I never saw one redder.  You can always\ntell weather by sunsets.\"\n\nThey looked out across the endless acres of Gerald O'Hara's newly\nplowed cotton fields toward the red horizon.  Now that the sun was\nsetting in a welter of crimson behind the hills across the Flint\nRiver, the warmth of the April day was ebbing into a faint but\nbalmy chill.\n\nSpring had come early that year, with warm quick rains and sudden\nfrothing of pink peach blossoms and dogwood dappling with white\nstars the dark river swamp and far-off hills.  Already the plowing\nwas nearly finished, and the bloody glory of the sunset colored\nthe fresh-cut furrows of red Georgia clay to even redder hues.\nThe moist hungry earth, waiting upturned for the cotton seeds,\nshowed pinkish on the sandy tops of furrows, vermilion and scarlet\nand maroon where shadows lay along the sides of the trenches.  The\nwhitewashed brick plantation house seemed an island set in a wild\nred sea, a sea of spiraling, curving, crescent billows petrified\nsuddenly at the moment when the pink-tipped waves were breaking\ninto surf.

    "scm_summary": "Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but her arresting face, pointed chin, square jaw, and pale green eyes captivated the Tarleton twins, Stuart and Brent. Sitting with them on the porch of Tara, her father's plantation, Scarlett listened to them talk about the brewing war between the Confederacy and the Yankees. She was tired of hearing about it, but the twins were excited. They had just been expelled from the University of Georgia and were on their way home when they stopped at Tara. When they got home, their mother was occupied with a new stallion she had recently bought in Kentucky, so the boys were able to avoid her wrath for their expulsion. The next day, the twins, Tom, and Boyd were going to the Wilkes' barbecue, and Scarlett hoped it wouldn't rain. As the sun set, they looked out across the newly plowed cotton fields, and Stuart said you could tell the weather by sunsets.",
    "no_scm_summary": "This section describes the scene on the porch of Tara, a plantation in Georgia, on an April afternoon in 1861. Scarlett O'Hara, sixteen years old, is seated with the Tarleton twins, Stuart and Brent. Outside, the sun is setting behind the hills, and the freshly plowed cotton fields are glowing red in the twilight. Scarlett is bored with the twins' talk of war and secession, but the boys are enthusiastic, having just been expelled from university. They explain that the war is inevitable, as General Beauregard has shelled the Yankees out of Fort Sumter. Scarlett is unconvinced, and the boys quickly change the subject to their mother, who is a renowned horse breeder. They explain that she is too busy with the new stallion to scold them for their expulsion, and they have left Boyd behind to explain the situation to her. The conversation turns to the Wilkes' barbecue the next day, and the boys express hope that the weather will be clear."

    "paragraph": " For here were no long, straight furrows, such as could\nbe seen in the yellow clay fields of the flat middle Georgia\ncountry or in the lush black earth of the coastal plantations.\nThe rolling foothill country of north Georgia was plowed in a\nmillion curves to keep the rich earth from washing down into the\nriver bottoms.\n\nIt was a savagely red land, blood-colored after rains, brick dust\nin droughts, the best cotton land in the world.  It was a pleasant\nland of white houses, peaceful plowed fields and sluggish yellow\nrivers, but a land of contrasts, of brightest sun glare and\ndensest shade.  The plantation clearings and miles of cotton\nfields smiled up to a warm sun, placid, complacent.  At their\nedges rose the virgin forests, dark and cool even in the hottest\nnoons, mysterious, a little sinister, the soughing pines seeming\nto wait with an age-old patience, to threaten with soft sighs:\n\"Be careful!  Be careful!  We had you once.  We can take you back\nagain.\"\n\nTo the ears of the three on the porch came the sounds of hooves,\nthe jingling of harness chains and the shrill careless laughter\nof negro voices, as the field hands and mules came in from the\nfields.  From within the house floated the soft voice of\nScarlett's mother, Ellen O'Hara, as she called to the little black\ngirl who carried her basket of keys.  The high-pitched, childish\nvoice answered \"Yas'm,\" and there were sounds of footsteps going\nout the back way toward the smokehouse where Ellen would ration\nout the food to the home-coming hands.  There was the click of\nchina and the rattle of silver as Pork, the valet-butler of Tara,\nlaid the table for supper.\n\nAt these last sounds, the twins realized it was time they were\nstarting home.  But they were loath to face their mother and they\nlingered on the porch of Tara, momentarily expecting Scarlett to\ngive them an invitation to supper.\n\n\"Look, Scarlett.  About tomorrow,\" said Brent.  \"Just because\nwe've been away and didn't know about the barbecue and the ball,\nthat's no reason why we shouldn't get plenty of dances tomorrow\nnight.  You haven't promised them all, have you?\"\n\n\"Well, I have!  How did I know you all would be home?  I couldn't\nrisk being a wallflower just waiting on you two.\"\n\n\"You a wallflower!\"  The boys laughed uproariously.\n\n\"Look, honey.  You've got to give me the first waltz and Stu the\nlast one and you've got to eat supper with us.  We'll sit on the\nstair landing like we did at the last ball and get Mammy Jincy to\ncome tell our fortunes again.\"\n\n\"I don't like Mammy Jincy's fortunes.  You know she said I was\ngoing to marry a gentleman with jet-black hair and a long black\nmustache, and I don't like black-haired gentlemen.\"\n\n\"You like 'em red-headed, don't you, honey?\" grinned Brent.  \"Now,\ncome on, promise us all the waltzes and the supper.\"\n\n\"If you'll promise, we'll tell you a secret,\" said Stuart.\n\n\"What?\" cried Scarlett, alert as a child at the word.\n\n\"Is it what we heard yesterday in Atlanta, Stu?  If it is, you\nknow we promised not to tell.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Pitty told us.\"\n\n\"Miss Who?\"\n\n\"You know, Ashley Wilkes' cousin who lives in Atlanta, Miss\nPittypat Hamilton--Charles and Melanie Hamilton's aunt.\"\n\n\"I do, and a sillier old lady I never met in all my life.\"\n\n\"Well, when we were in Atlanta yesterday, waiting for the home\ntrain, her carriage went by the depot and she stopped and talked\nto us, and she told us there was going to be an engagement\nannounced tomorrow night at the Wilkes ball.\"\n\n\"Oh.  I know about that,\" said Scarlett in disappointment.  \"That\nsilly nephew of hers, Charlie Hamilton, and Honey Wilkes.\nEverybody's known for years that they'd get married some time,\neven if he did seem kind of lukewarm about it.\"\n\n\"Do you think he's silly?\" questioned Brent.  \"Last Christmas you\nsure let him buzz round you plenty.\"\n\n\"I couldn't help him buzzing,\" Scarlett shrugged negligently.  \"I\nthink he's an awful sissy.\"\n\n\"Besides, it isn't his engagement that's going to be announced,\"\nsaid Stuart triumphantly.  \"It's Ashley's to Charlie's sister,\nMiss Melanie!\"\n\nScarlett's face did not change but her lips went white--like a\nperson who has received a stunning blow without warning and who,\nin the first moments of shock, does not realize what has happened.\nSo still was her face as she stared at Stuart that he, never\nanalytic, took it for granted that she was merely surprised and\nvery interested.\n\n\"Miss Pitty told us they hadn't intended announcing it till next\nyear, because Miss Melly hasn't been very well; but with all the\nwar talk going around, everybody in both families thought it would\nbe better to get married soon.  So it's to be announced tomorrow\nnight at the supper intermission.  Now, Scarlett, we've told you\nthe secret, so you've got to promise to eat supper with us.\"\n\n\"Of course I will,\" Scarlett said automatically.\n\n\"And all the waltzes?\"\n\n\"All.\"\n\n\"You're sweet!  I'll bet the other boys will be hopping mad.\"\n\n\"Let 'em be mad,\" said Brent.  \"We two can handle 'em.  Look,\nScarlett.  Sit with us at the barbecue in the morning.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nStuart repeated his request.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThe twins looked at each other jubilantly but with some surprise.\nAlthough they considered themselves Scarlett's favored suitors,\nthey had never before gained tokens of this favor so easily.\nUsually she made them beg and plead, while she put them off,\nrefusing to give a Yes or No answer, laughing if they sulked,\ngrowing cool if they became angry.  And here she had practically\npromised them the whole of tomorrow--seats by her at the barbecue,\nall the waltzes (and they'd see to it that the dances were all\nwaltzes!) and the supper intermission.  This was worth getting\nexpelled from the university.\n\nFilled with new enthusiasm by their success, they lingered on,\ntalking about the barbecue and the ball and Ashley Wilkes and\nMelanie Hamilton, interrupting each other, making jokes and\nlaughing at them, hinting broadly for invitations to supper.  Some\ntime had passed before they realized that Scarlett was having very\nlittle to say.  The atmosphere had somehow changed.  Just how, the\ntwins did not know, but the fine glow had gone out of the\nafternoon.  Scarlett seemed to be paying little attention to what\nthey said, although she made the correct answers.  Sensing\nsomething they could not understand, baffled and annoyed by it,\nthe twins struggled along for a while, and then rose reluctantly,\nlooking at their watches.\n\nThe sun was low across the new-plowed fields and the tall woods\nacross the river were looming blackly in silhouette.  Chimney\nswallows were darting swiftly across the yard, and chickens, ducks\nand turkeys were waddling and strutting and straggling in from the\nfields.\n\nStuart bellowed:  \"Jeems!\"  And after an interval a tall black boy\nof their own age ran breathlessly around the house and out toward\nthe tethered horses.  Jeems was their body servant and, like the\ndogs, accompanied them everywhere.  He had been their childhood\nplaymate and had been given to the twins for their own on their\ntenth birthday.  At the sight of him, the Tarleton hounds rose up\nout of the red dust and stood waiting expectantly for their\nmasters.  The boys bowed, shook hands and told Scarlett they'd be\nover at the Wilkeses' early in the morning, waiting for her.  Then\nthey were off down the walk at a rush, mounted their horses and,\nfollowed by Jeems, went down the avenue of cedars at a gallop,\nwaving their hats and yelling back to her.\n\nWhen they had rounded the curve of the dusty road that hid them\nfrom Tara, Brent drew his horse to a stop under a clump of\ndogwood.  Stuart halted, too, and the darky boy pulled up a few\npaces behind them.  The horses, feeling slack reins, stretched\ndown their necks to crop the tender spring grass, and the patient\nhounds lay down again in the soft red dust and looked up longingly\nat the chimney swallows circling in the gathering dusk.  Brent's\nwide ingenuous face was puzzled and mildly indignant.\n\n\"Look,\" he said.  \"Don't it look to you like she would of asked us\nto stay for supper?\"\n\n\"I thought she would,\" said Stuart.  \"I kept waiting for her to do\nit, but she didn't.  What do you make of it?\"\n\n\"I don't make anything of it.  But it just looks to me like she\nmight of.  After all, it's our first day home and she hasn't seen\nus in quite a spell.  And we had lots more things to tell her.\"\n\n\"It looked to me like she was mighty glad to see us when we came.\"\n\n\"I thought so, too.\"\n\n\"And then, about a half-hour ago, she got kind of quiet, like she\nhad a headache.\"\n\n\"I noticed that but I didn't pay it any mind then.  What do you\nsuppose ailed her?\"\n\n\"I dunno.  Do you suppose we said something that made her mad?\"\n\nThey both thought for a minute.\n\n\"I can't think of anything.  Besides, when Scarlett gets mad,\neverybody knows it.  She don't hold herself in like some girls\ndo.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what I like about her.  She don't go around being\ncold and hateful when she's mad--she tells you about it.  But it\nwas something we did or said that made her shut up talking and\nlook sort of sick.  I could swear she was glad to see us when we\ncame and was aiming to ask us to supper.\"\n\n\"You don't suppose it's because we got expelled?\"\n\n\"Hell, no!  Don't be a fool.  She laughed like everything when we\ntold her about it.  And besides Scarlett don't set any more store\nby book learning than we do.\"\n\nBrent turned in the saddle and called to the negro groom.\n\n\"Jeems!\"\n\n\"Suh?\"\n\n\"You heard what we were talking to Miss Scarlett about?\"\n\n\"Nawsuh, Mist' Brent!  Huccome you think Ah be spyin' on w'ite\nfolks?\"\n\n\"Spying, my God!  You darkies know everything that goes on.  Why,\nyou liar, I saw you with my own eyes sidle round the corner of the\nporch and squat in the cape jessamine bush by the wall.  Now, did\nyou hear us say anything that might have made Miss Scarlett mad--\nor hurt her feelings?\"\n\nThus appealed to, Jeems gave up further pretense of not having\noverheard the conversation and furrowed his black brow.\n\n\"Nawsuh, Ah din' notice y'all say anything ter mek her mad.  Look\nter me lak she sho glad ter see you an' sho had missed you, an'\nshe cheep along happy as a bird, tell 'bout de time y'all got ter\ntalkin' 'bout Mist' Ashley an' Miss Melly Hamilton gittin'\nmah'ied.  Den she quiet down lak a bird w'en de hawk fly ober.\"\n\nThe twins looked at each other and nodded, but without comprehension.\n\n\"Jeems is right.  But I don't see why,\" said Stuart.  \"My Lord!\nAshley don't mean anything to her, 'cept a friend.  She's not\ncrazy about him.  It's us she's crazy about.\"\n\nBrent nodded an agreement.\n\n\"But do you suppose,\" he said, \"that maybe Ashley hadn't told her\nhe was going to announce it tomorrow night and she was mad at him\nfor not telling her, an old friend, before he told everybody else?\nGirls set a big store on knowing such things first.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe.  But what if he hadn't told her it was tomorrow?  It\nwas supposed to be a secret and a surprise, and a man's got a\nright to keep his own engagement quiet, hasn't he?  We wouldn't\nhave known it if Miss Melly's aunt hadn't let it out.  But\nScarlett must have known he was going to marry Miss Melly\nsometime.  Why, we've known it for years.  The Wilkes and\nHamiltons always marry their own cousins.  Everybody knew he'd\nprobably marry her some day, just like Honey Wilkes is going to\nmarry Miss Melly's brother, Charles.\"\n\n\"Well, I give it up.  But I'm sorry she didn't ask us to supper.\nI swear I don't want to go home and listen to Ma take on about us\nbeing expelled.  It isn't as if this was the first time.\"\n\n\"Maybe Boyd will have smoothed her down by now.  You know what a\nslick talker that little varmint is.  You know he always can\nsmooth her down.\"\n\n\"Yes, he can do it, but it takes Boyd time. ",

Although the twins noticed that Scarlett's mood changed after they talked about Ashley Wilkes' upcoming engagement to Melanie Hamilton, they could not figure out what had happened. They speculated that Scarlett was mad at Ashley for not telling her about the engagement before announcing it to everyone else, but they dismissed this idea since Scarlett was not in love with Ashley. They were disappointed that Scarlett did not invite them to stay for supper, but they were comforted by the idea that Boyd might have already smoothed things over with their mother.",

    "paragraph": " He has to talk around\nin circles till Ma gets so confused that she gives up and tells\nhim to save his voice for his law practice.  But he ain't had time\nto get good started yet.  Why, I'll bet you Ma is still so excited\nabout the new horse that she'll never even realize we're home\nagain till she sits down to supper tonight and sees Boyd.  And\nbefore supper is over she'll be going strong and breathing fire.\nAnd it'll be ten o'clock before Boyd gets a chance to tell her\nthat it wouldn't have been honorable for any of us to stay in\ncollege after the way the Chancellor talked to you and me.  And\nit'll be midnight before he gets her turned around to where she's\nso mad at the Chancellor she'll be asking Boyd why he didn't shoot\nhim.  No, we can't go home till after midnight.\"\n\nThe twins looked at each other glumly.  They were completely\nfearless of wild horses, shooting affrays and the indignation of\ntheir neighbors, but they had a wholesome fear of their red-haired\nmother's outspoken remarks and the riding crop that she did not\nscruple to lay across their breeches.\n\n\"Well, look,\" said Brent.  \"Let's go over to the Wilkes.  Ashley\nand the girls'll be glad to have us for supper.\"\n\nStuart looked a little discomforted.\n\n\"No, don't let's go there.  They'll be in a stew getting ready for\nthe barbecue tomorrow and besides--\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot about that,\" said Brent hastily.  \"No, don't let's\ngo there.\"\n\nThey clucked to their horses and rode along in silence for a\nwhile, a flush of embarrassment on Stuart's brown cheeks.  Until\nthe previous summer, Stuart had courted India Wilkes with the\napprobation of both families and the entire County.  The County\nfelt that perhaps the cool and contained India Wilkes would have a\nquieting effect on him.  They fervently hoped so, at any rate.\nAnd Stuart might have made the match, but Brent had not been\nsatisfied.  Brent liked India but he thought her mighty plain and\ntame, and he simply could not fall in love with her himself to\nkeep Stuart company.  That was the first time the twins' interest\nhad ever diverged, and Brent was resentful of his brother's\nattentions to a girl who seemed to him not at all remarkable.\n\nThen, last summer at a political speaking in a grove of oak trees\nat Jonesboro, they both suddenly became aware of Scarlett O'Hara.\nThey had known her for years, and, since their childhood, she had\nbeen a favorite playmate, for she could ride horses and climb\ntrees almost as well as they.  But now to their amazement she had\nbecome a grown-up young lady and quite the most charming one in\nall the world.\n\nThey noticed for the first time how her green eyes danced, how\ndeep her dimples were when she laughed, how tiny her hands and\nfeet and what a small waist she had.  Their clever remarks sent\nher into merry peals of laughter and, inspired by the thought that\nshe considered them a remarkable pair, they fairly outdid\nthemselves.\n\nIt was a memorable day in the life of the twins.  Thereafter, when\nthey talked it over, they always wondered just why they had failed\nto notice Scarlett's charms before.  They never arrived at the\ncorrect answer, which was that Scarlett on that day had decided to\nmake them notice.  She was constitutionally unable to endure any\nman being in love with any woman not herself, and the sight of\nIndia Wilkes and Stuart at the speaking had been too much for her\npredatory nature.  Not content with Stuart alone, she had set her\ncap for Brent as well, and with a thoroughness that overwhelmed\nthe two of them.\n\nNow they were both in love with her, and India Wilkes and Letty\nMunroe, from Lovejoy, whom Brent had been half-heartedly courting,\nwere far in the back of their minds.  Just what the loser would\ndo, should Scarlett accept either one of them, the twins did not\nask.  They would cross that bridge when they came to it.  For the\npresent they were quite satisfied to be in accord again about one\ngirl, for they had no jealousies between them.  It was a situation\nwhich interested the neighbors and annoyed their mother, who had\nno liking for Scarlett.\n\n\"It will serve you right if that sly piece does accept one of\nyou,\" she said.  \"Or maybe she'll accept both of you, and then\nyou'll have to move to Utah, if the Mormons'll have you--which I\ndoubt. . . .  All that bothers me is that some one of these days\nyou're both going to get lickered up and jealous of each other\nabout that two-faced, little, green-eyed baggage, and you'll shoot\neach other.  But that might not be a bad idea either.\"\n\nSince the day of the speaking, Stuart had been uncomfortable in\nIndia's presence.  Not that India ever reproached him or even\nindicated by look or gesture that she was aware of his abruptly\nchanged allegiance.  She was too much of a lady.  But Stuart felt\nguilty and ill at ease with her.  He knew he had made India love\nhim and he knew that she still loved him and, deep in his heart,\nhe had the feeling that he had not played the gentleman.  He still\nliked her tremendously and respected her for her cool good\nbreeding, her book learning and all the sterling qualities she\npossessed.  But, damn it, she was just so pallid and uninteresting\nand always the same, beside Scarlett's bright and changeable\ncharm.  You always knew where you stood with India and you never\nhad the slightest notion with Scarlett.  That was enough to drive\na man to distraction, but it had its charm.\n\n\"Well, let's go over to Cade Calvert's and have supper.  Scarlett\nsaid Cathleen was home from Charleston.  Maybe she'll have some\nnews about Fort Sumter that we haven't heard.\"\n\n\"Not Cathleen.  I'll lay you two to one she didn't even know the\nfort was out there in the harbor, much less that it was full of\nYankees until we shelled them out.  All she'll know about is the\nballs she went to and the beaux she collected.\"\n\n\"Well, it's fun to hear her gabble.  And it'll be somewhere to\nhide out till Ma has gone to bed.\"\n\n\"Well, hell!  I like Cathleen and she is fun and I'd like to hear\nabout Caro Rhett and the rest of the Charleston folks; but I'm\ndamned if I can stand sitting through another meal with that\nYankee stepmother of hers.\"\n\n\"Don't be too hard on her, Stuart.  She means well.\"\n\n\"I'm not being hard on her.  I feel sorry for her, but I don't\nlike people I've got to feel sorry for.  And she fusses around so\nmuch, trying to do the right thing and make you feel at home, that\nshe always manages to say and do just exactly the wrong thing.\nShe gives me the fidgets!  And she thinks Southerners are wild\nbarbarians.  She even told Ma so.  She's afraid of Southerners.\nWhenever we're there she always looks scared to death.  She\nreminds me of a skinny hen perched on a chair, her eyes kind of\nbright and blank and scared, all ready to flap and squawk at the\nslightest move anybody makes.\"\n\n\"Well, you can't blame her.  You did shoot Cade in the leg.\"\n\n\"Well, I was lickered up or I wouldn't have done it,\" said Stuart.\n\"And Cade never had any hard feelings.  Neither did Cathleen or\nRaiford or Mr. Calvert.  It was just that Yankee stepmother who\nsqualled and said I was a wild barbarian and decent people weren't\nsafe around uncivilized Southerners.\"\n\n\"Well, you can't blame her.  She's a Yankee and ain't got very\ngood manners; and, after all, you did shoot him and he is her\nstepson.\"\n\n\"Well, hell!  That's no excuse for insulting me!  You are Ma's own\nblood son, but did she take on that time Tony Fontaine shot you in\nthe leg?  No, she just sent for old Doc Fontaine to dress it and\nasked the doctor what ailed Tony's aim.  Said she guessed licker\nwas spoiling his marksmanship.  Remember how mad that made Tony?\"\n\nBoth boys yelled with laughter.\n\n\"Ma's a card!\" said Brent with loving approval.  \"You can always\ncount on her to do the right thing and not embarrass you in front\nof folks.\"\n\n\"Yes, but she's mighty liable to talk embarrassing in front of\nFather and the girls when we get home tonight,\" said Stuart\ngloomily.  \"Look, Brent.  I guess this means we don't go to\nEurope.  You know Mother said if we got expelled from another\ncollege we couldn't have our Grand Tour.\"\n\n\"Well, hell!  We don't care, do we?  What is there to see in\nEurope?  I'll bet those foreigners can't show us a thing we\nhaven't got right here in Georgia.  I'll bet their horses aren't\nas fast or their girls as pretty, and I know damn well they\nhaven't got any rye whisky that can touch Father's.\"\n\n\"Ashley Wilkes said they had an awful lot of scenery and music.\nAshley liked Europe.  He's always talking about it.\"\n\n\"Well--you know how the Wilkes are.  They are kind of queer about\nmusic and books and scenery.  Mother says it's because their\ngrandfather came from Virginia.  She says Virginians set quite a\nstore by such things.\"\n\n\"They can have 'em.  Give me a good horse to ride and some good\nlicker to drink and a good girl to court and a bad girl to have\nfun with and anybody can have their Europe. . . .  What do we care\nabout missing the Tour?  Suppose we were in Europe now, with the\nwar coming on?  We couldn't get home soon enough.  I'd heap rather\ngo to a war than go to Europe.\"\n\n\"So would I, any day. . . .  Look, Brent!  I know where we can go\nfor supper.  Let's ride across the swamp to Abel Wynder's place\nand tell him we're all four home again and ready for drill.\"\n\n\"That's an idea!\" cried Brent with enthusiasm.  \"And we can hear\nall the news of the Troop and find out what color they finally\ndecided on for the uniforms.\"\n\n\"If it's Zouave, I'm damned if I'll go in the troop.  I'd feel\nlike a sissy in those baggy red pants.  They look like ladies' red\nflannel drawers to me.\"\n\n\"Is y'all aimin' ter go ter Mist' Wynder's?  'Cause ef you is, you\nain' gwine git much supper,\" said Jeems.  \"Dey cook done died, an'\ndey ain' bought a new one.  Dey got a fe'el han' cookin', an' de\nniggers tells me she is de wustest cook in de state.\"\n\n\"Good God!  Why don't they buy another cook?\"\n\n\"Huccome po' w'ite trash buy any niggers?  Dey ain' never owned\nmo'n fo' at de mostes'.\"\n\nThere was frank contempt in Jeems' voice.  His own social status\nwas assured because the Tarletons owned a hundred negroes and,\nlike all slaves of large planters, he looked down on small farmers\nwhose slaves were few.\n\n\"I'm going to beat your hide off for that,\" cried Stuart fiercely.\nDon't you call Abel Wynder 'po' white.'  Sure he's poor, but he\nain't trash; and I'm damned if I'll have any man, darky or white,\nthrowing off on him.  There ain't a better man in this County, or\nwhy else did the Troop elect him lieutenant?\"\n\n\"Ah ain' never figgered dat out, mahseff,\" replied Jeems,\nundisturbed by his master's scowl.  \"Look ter me lak dey'd 'lect\nall de awficers frum rich gempmum, 'stead of swamp trash.\"\n\n\"He ain't trash!  Do you mean to compare him with real white trash\nlike the Slatterys?  Able just ain't rich.  He's a small farmer,\nnot a big planter, and if the boys thought enough of him to elect\nhim lieutenant, then it's not for any darky to talk impudent about\nhim.  The Troop knows what it's doing.\"\n\nThe troop of cavalry had been organized three months before, the\nvery day that Georgia seceded from the Union, and since then the\nrecruits had been whistling for war.  The outfit was as yet\nunnamed, though not for want of suggestions.  Everyone had his own\nidea on that subject and was loath to relinquish it, just as\neveryone had ideas about the color and cut of the uniforms.\n\"Clayton Wild Cats,\" \"Fire Eaters,\" \"North Georgia Hussars,\"\n\"Zouaves,\" \"The Inland Rifles\" (although the Troop was to be armed\nwith pistols, sabers and bowie knives, and not with rifles), \"The\nClayton Grays,\" \"The Blood and Thunderers,\" \"The Rough and\nReadys,\" all had their adherents.

    "paragraph": " Until matters were settled,\neveryone referred to the organization as the Troop and, despite\nthe high-sounding name finally adopted, they were known to the end\nof their usefulness simply as \"The Troop.\"\n\nThe officers were elected by the members, for no one in the County\nhad had any military experience except a few veterans of the\nMexican and Seminole wars and, besides, the Troop would have\nscorned a veteran as a leader if they had not personally liked him\nand trusted him.  Everyone liked the four Tarleton boys and the\nthree Fontaines, but regretfully refused to elect them, because\nthe Tarletons got lickered up too quickly and liked to skylark,\nand the Fontaines had such quick, murderous tempers.  Ashley\nWilkes was elected captain, because he was the best rider in the\nCounty and because his cool head was counted on to keep some\nsemblance of order.  Raiford Calvert was made first lieutenant,\nbecause everybody liked Raif, and Able Wynder, son of a swamp\ntrapper, himself a small farmer, was elected second lieutenant.\n\nAbel was a shrewd, grave giant, illiterate, kind of heart, older\nthan the other boys and with as good or better manners in the\npresence of ladies.  There was little snobbery in the Troop.  Too\nmany of their fathers and grandfathers had come up to wealth from\nthe small farmer class for that.  Moreover, Able was the best shot\nin the Troop, a real sharpshooter who could pick out the eye of a\nsquirrel at seventy-five yards, and, too, he knew all about living\noutdoors, building fires in the rain, tracking animals and finding\nwater.  The Troop bowed to real worth and moreover, because they\nliked him, they made him an officer.  He bore the honor gravely\nand with no untoward conceit, as though it were only his due.  But\nthe planters' ladies and the planters' slaves could not overlook\nthe fact that he was not born a gentleman, even if their men folks\ncould.\n\nIn the beginning, the Troop had been recruited exclusively from\nthe sons of planters, a gentleman's outfit, each man supplying his\nown horse, arms, equipment, uniform and body servant.  But rich\nplanters were few in the young county of Clayton, and, in order to\nmuster a full-strength troop, it had been necessary to raise more\nrecruits among the sons of small farmers, hunters in the\nbackwoods, swamp trappers, Crackers and, in a very few cases, even\npoor whites, if they were above the average of their class.\n\nThese latter young men were as anxious to fight the Yankees,\nshould war come, as were their richer neighbors; but the delicate\nquestion of money arose.  Few small farmers owned horses.  They\ncarried on their farm operations with mules and they had no\nsurplus of these, seldom more than four.  The mules could not be\nspared to go off to war, even if they had been acceptable for the\nTroop, which they emphatically were not.  As for the poor whites,\nthey considered themselves well off if they owned one mule.  The\nbackwoods folks and the swamp dwellers owned neither horses nor\nmules.  They lived entirely off the produce of their lands and the\ngame in the swamp, conducting their business generally by the\nbarter system and seldom seeing five dollars in cash a year, and\nhorses and uniforms were out of their reach.  But they were as\nfiercely proud in their poverty as the planters were in their\nwealth, and they would accept nothing that smacked of charity from\ntheir rich neighbors.  So, to save the feelings of all and to\nbring the Troop up to full strength, Scarlett's father, John\nWilkes, Buck Munroe, Jim Tarleton, Hugh Calvert, in fact every\nlarge planter in the County with the one exception of Angus\nMacIntosh, had contributed money to completely outfit the Troop,\nhorse and man.  The upshot of the matter was that every planter\nagreed to pay for equipping his own sons and a certain number of\nthe others, but the manner of handling the arrangements was such\nthat the less wealthy members of the outfit could accept horses\nand uniforms without offense to their honor.\n\nThe Troop met twice a week in Jonesboro to drill and to pray for\nthe war to begin.  Arrangements had not yet been completed for\nobtaining the full quota of horses, but those who had horses\nperformed what they imagined to be cavalry maneuvers in the field\nbehind the courthouse, kicked up a great deal of dust, yelled\nthemselves hoarse and waved the Revolutionary-war swords that had\nbeen taken down from parlor walls.  Those who, as yet, had no\nhorses sat on the curb in front of Bullard's store and watched\ntheir mounted comrades, chewed tobacco and told yarns.  Or else\nengaged in shooting matches.  There was no need to teach any of\nthe men to shoot.  Most Southerners were born with guns in their\nhands, and lives spent in hunting had made marksmen of them all.\n\nFrom planters' homes and swamp cabins, a varied array of firearms\ncame to each muster.  There were long squirrel guns that had been\nnew when first the Alleghenies were crossed, old muzzle-loaders\nthat had claimed many an Indian when Georgia was new, horse\npistols that had seen service in 1812, in the Seminole wars and in\nMexico, silver-mounted dueling pistols, pocket derringers, double-\nbarreled hunting pieces and handsome new rifles of English make\nwith shining stocks of fine wood.\n\nDrill always ended in the saloons of Jonesboro, and by nightfall\nso many fights had broken out that the officers were hard put to\nward off casualties until the Yankees could inflict them.  It was\nduring one of these brawls that Stuart Tarleton had shot Cade\nCalvert and Tony Fontaine had shot Brent.  The twins had been at\nhome, freshly expelled from the University of Virginia, at the\ntime the Troop was organized and they had joined enthusiastically;\nbut after the shooting episode, two months ago, their mother had\npacked them off to the state university, with orders to stay\nthere.  They had sorely missed the excitement of the drills while\naway, and they counted education well lost if only they could ride\nand yell and shoot off rifles in the company of their friends.\n\n\"Well, let's cut across country to Abel's,\" suggested Brent.  \"We\ncan go through Mr. O'Hara's river bottom and the Fontaine's\npasture and get there in no time.\"\n\n\"We ain' gwine git nothin' ter eat 'cept possum an' greens,\"\nargued Jeems.\n\n\"You ain't going to get anything,\" grinned Stuart.  \"Because you\nare going home and tell Ma that we won't be home for supper.\"\n\n\"No, Ah ain'!\" cried Jeems in alarm.  \"No, Ah ain'!  Ah doan git\nno mo' fun outer havin' Miss Beetriss lay me out dan y'all does.\nFust place she'll ast me huccome Ah let y'all git expelled agin.\nAn' nex' thing, huccome Ah din' bring y'all home ternight so she\ncould lay you out.  An' den she'll light on me lak a duck on a\nJune bug, an' fust thing Ah know Ah'll be ter blame fer it all.\nEf y'all doan tek me ter Mist' Wynder's, Ah'll lay out in de woods\nall night an' maybe de patterollers git me, 'cause Ah heap ruther\nde patterollers git me dan Miss Beetriss when she in a state.\"\n\nThe twins looked at the determined black boy in perplexity and\nindignation.\n\n\"He'd be just fool enough to let the patterollers get him and that\nwould give Ma something else to talk about for weeks.  I swear,\ndarkies are more trouble.  Sometimes I think the Abolitionists\nhave got the right idea.\"\n\n\"Well, it wouldn't be right to make Jeems face what we don't want\nto face.  We'll have to take him.  But, look, you impudent black\nfool, if you put on any airs in front of the Wynder darkies and\nhint that we all the time have fried chicken and ham, while they\ndon't have nothing but rabbit and possum, I'll--I'll tell Ma.  And\nwe won't let you go to the war with us, either.\"\n\n\"Airs?  Me put on airs fo' dem cheap niggers?  Nawsuh, Ah got\nbetter manners.  Ain' Miss Beetriss taught me manners same as she\ntaught y'all?\"\n\n\"She didn't do a very good job on any of the three of us,\" said\nStuart.  \"Come on, let's get going.\"\n\nHe backed his big red horse and then, putting spurs to his side,\nlifted him easily over the split rail fence into the soft field of\nGerald O'Hara's plantation.  Brent's horse followed and then\nJeems', with Jeems clinging to pommel and mane.  Jeems did not\nlike to jump fences, but he had jumped higher ones than this in\norder to keep up with his masters.\n\nAs they picked their way across the red furrows and down the hill\nto the river bottom in the deepening dusk, Brent yelled to his\nbrother:\n\n\"Look, Stu!  Don't it seem like to you that Scarlett WOULD have\nasked us to supper?\"\n\n\"I kept thinking she would,\" yelled Stuart.  \"Why do you\nsuppose . . .\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nWhen the twins left Scarlett standing on the porch of Tara and the\nlast sound of flying hooves had died away, she went back to her\nchair like a sleepwalker.  Her face felt stiff as from pain and\nher mouth actually hurt from having stretched it, unwillingly, in\nsmiles to prevent the twins from learning her secret.  She sat\ndown wearily, tucking one foot under her, and her heart swelled up\nwith misery, until it felt too large for her bosom.  It beat with\nodd little jerks; her hands were cold, and a feeling of disaster\noppressed her.  There were pain and bewilderment in her face, the\nbewilderment of a pampered child who has always had her own way\nfor the asking and who now, for the first time, was in contact\nwith the unpleasantness of life.\n\nAshley to marry Melanie Hamilton!\n\nOh, it couldn't be true!  The twins were mistaken.  They were\nplaying one of their jokes on her.  Ashley couldn't, couldn't be\nin love with her.  Nobody could, not with a mousy little person\nlike Melanie.  Scarlett recalled with contempt Melanie's thin\nchildish figure, her serious heart-shaped face that was plain\nalmost to homeliness.  And Ashley couldn't have seen her in\nmonths.  He hadn't been in Atlanta more than twice since the house\nparty he gave last year at Twelve Oaks.  No, Ashley couldn't be in\nlove with Melanie, because--oh, she couldn't be mistaken!--because\nhe was in love with her!  She, Scarlett, was the one he loved--she\nknew it!\n\nScarlett heard Mammy's lumbering tread shaking the floor of the\nhall and she hastily untucked her foot and tried to rearrange her\nface in more placid lines.  It would never do for Mammy to suspect\nthat anything was wrong.  Mammy felt that she owned the O'Haras,\nbody and soul, that their secrets were her secrets; and even a\nhint of a mystery was enough to set her upon the trail as\nrelentlessly as a bloodhound.  Scarlett knew from experience that,\nif Mammy's curiosity were not immediately satisfied, she would\ntake up the matter with Ellen, and then Scarlett would be forced\nto reveal everything to her mother, or think up some plausible\nlie.\n\nMammy emerged from the hall, a huge old woman with the small,\nshrewd eyes of an elephant.  She was shining black, pure African,\ndevoted to her last drop of blood to the O'Haras, Ellen's\nmainstay, the despair of her three daughters, the terror of the\nother house servants.  Mammy was black, but her code of conduct\nand her sense of pride were as high as or higher than those of her\nowners.  She had been raised in the bedroom of Solange Robillard,\nEllen O'Hara's mother, a dainty, cold, high-nosed French-woman,\nwho spared neither her children nor her servants their just\npunishment for any infringement of decorum.  She had been Ellen's\nmammy and had come with her from Savannah to the up-country when\nshe married.  Whom Mammy loved, she chastened.  And, as her love\nfor Scarlett and her pride in her were enormous, the chastening\nprocess was practically continuous.\n\n\"Is de gempmum gone?  Huccome you din' ast dem ter stay fer\nsupper, Miss Scarlett?  Ah done tole Poke ter lay two extry plates\nfer dem.  Whar's yo' manners?\"\n\n\"Oh, I was so tired of hearing them talk about the war that I\ncouldn't have endured it through supper, especially with Pa\njoining in and shouting about Mr. Lincoln.\"\n\n\"You ain' got no mo' manners dan a fe'el han', an' after Miss\nEllen an' me done labored wid you.

    "paragraph": " An' hyah you is widout yo'\nshawl!  An' de night air fixin' ter set in!  Ah done tole you an'\ntole you 'bout gittin' fever frum settin' in de night air wid\nnuthin' on yo' shoulders.  Come on in de house, Miss Scarlett.\"\n\nScarlett turned away from Mammy with studied nonchalance, thankful\nthat her face had been unnoticed in Mammy's preoccupation with the\nmatter of the shawl.\n\n\"No, I want to sit here and watch the sunset.  It's so pretty.\nYou run get my shawl.  Please, Mammy, and I'll sit here till Pa\ncomes home.\"\n\n\"Yo' voice soun' lak you catchin' a cole,\" said Mammy suspiciously.\n\n\"Well, I'm not,\" said Scarlett impatiently.  \"You fetch me my\nshawl.\"\n\nMammy waddled back into the hall and Scarlett heard her call\nsoftly up the stairwell to the upstairs maid.\n\n\"You, Rosa!  Drap me Miss Scarlett's shawl.\"  Then, more loudly:\n\"Wuthless nigger!  She ain' never whar she does nobody no good.\nNow, Ah got ter climb up an' git it mahseff.\"\n\nScarlett heard the stairs groan and she got softly to her feet.\nWhen Mammy returned she would resume her lecture on Scarlett's\nbreach of hospitality, and Scarlett felt that she could not endure\nprating about such a trivial matter when her heart was breaking.\nAs she stood, hesitant, wondering where she could hide until the\nache in her breast subsided a little, a thought came to her,\nbringing a small ray of hope.  Her father had ridden over to\nTwelve Oaks, the Wilkes plantation, that afternoon to offer to buy\nDilcey, the broad wife of his valet, Pork.  Dilcey was head woman\nand midwife at Twelve Oaks, and, since the marriage six months\nago, Pork had deviled his master night and day to buy Dilcey, so\nthe two could live on the same plantation.  That afternoon,\nGerald, his resistance worn thin, had set out to make an offer for\nDilcey.\n\nSurely, thought Scarlett, Pa will know whether this awful story is\ntrue.  Even if he hasn't actually heard anything this afternoon,\nperhaps he's noticed something, sensed some excitement in the\nWilkes family.  If I can just see him privately before supper,\nperhaps I'll find out the truth--that it's just one of the twins'\nnasty practical jokes.\n\nIt was time for Gerald's return and, if she expected to see him\nalone, there was nothing for her to do except meet him where the\ndriveway entered the road.  She went quietly down the front steps,\nlooking carefully over her shoulder to make sure Mammy was not\nobserving her from the upstairs windows.  Seeing no broad black\nface, turbaned in snowy white, peering disapprovingly from between\nfluttering curtains, she boldly snatched up her green flowered\nskirts and sped down the path toward the driveway as fast as her\nsmall ribbon-laced slippers would carry her.\n\nThe dark cedars on either side of the graveled drive met in an\narch overhead, turning the long avenue into a dim tunnel.  As soon\nas she was beneath the gnarled arms of the cedars, she knew she\nwas safe from observation from the house and she slowed her swift\npace.  She was panting, for her stays were laced too tightly to\npermit much running, but she walked on as rapidly as she could.\nSoon she was at the end of the driveway and out on the main road,\nbut she did not stop until she had rounded a curve that put a\nlarge clump of trees between her and the house.\n\nFlushed and breathing hard, she sat down on a stump to wait for\nher father.  It was past time for him to come home, but she was\nglad that he was late.  The delay would give her time to quiet her\nbreathing and calm her face so that his suspicions would not be\naroused.  Every moment she expected to hear the pounding of his\nhorse's hooves and see him come charging up the hill at his usual\nbreakneck speed.  But the minutes slipped by and Gerald did not\ncome.  She looked down the road for him, the pain in her heart\nswelling up again.\n\n\"Oh, it can't be true!\" she thought.  \"Why doesn't he come?\"\n\nHer eyes followed the winding road, blood-red now after the\nmorning rain.  In her thought she traced its course as it ran down\nthe hill to the sluggish Flint River, through the tangled swampy\nbottoms and up the next hill to Twelve Oaks where Ashley lived.\nThat was all the road meant now--a road to Ashley and the\nbeautiful white-columned house that crowned the hill like a Greek\nTemple.\n\n\"Oh, Ashley!  Ashley!\" she thought, and her heart beat faster.\n\nSome of the cold sense of bewilderment and disaster that had\nweighted her down since the Tarleton boys told her their gossip\nwas pushed into the background of her mind, and in its place crept\nthe fever that had possessed her for two years.\n\nIt seemed strange now that when she was growing up Ashley had\nnever seemed so very attractive to her.  In childhood days, she\nhad seen him come and go and never given him a thought.  But since\nthat day two years ago when Ashley, newly home from his three\nyears' Grand Tour in Europe, had called to pay his respects, she\nhad loved him.  It was as simple as that.\n\nShe had been on the front porch and he had ridden up the long\navenue, dressed in gray broadcloth with a wide black cravat\nsetting off his frilled shirt to perfection.  Even now, she could\nrecall each detail of his dress, how brightly his boots shone, the\nhead of a Medusa in cameo on his cravat pin, the wide Panama hat\nthat was instantly in his hand when he saw her.  He had alighted\nand tossed his bridle reins to a pickaninny and stood looking up\nat her, his drowsy gray eyes wide with a smile and the sun so\nbright on his blond hair that it seemed like a cap of shining\nsilver.  And he said, \"So you've grown up, Scarlett.\"  And, coming\nlightly up the steps, he had kissed her hand.  And his voice!  She\nwould never forget the leap of her heart as she heard it, as if\nfor the first time, drawling, resonant, musical.\n\nShe had wanted him, in that first instant, wanted him as simply\nand unreasoningly as she wanted food to eat, horses to ride and a\nsoft bed on which to lay herself.\n\nFor two years he had squired her about the County, to balls, fish\nfries, picnics and court days, never so often as the Tarleton\ntwins or Cade Calvert, never so importunate as the younger\nFontaine boys, but, still, never the week went by that Ashley did\nnot come calling at Tara.\n\nTrue, he never made love to her, nor did the clear gray eyes ever\nglow with that hot light Scarlett knew so well in other men.  And\nyet--and yet--she knew he loved her.  She could not be mistaken\nabout it.  Instinct stronger than reason and knowledge born of\nexperience told her that he loved her.  Too often she had\nsurprised him when his eyes were neither drowsy nor remote, when\nhe looked at her with a yearning and a sadness which puzzled her.\nShe KNEW he loved her.  Why did he not tell her so?  That she\ncould not understand.  But there were so many things about him\nthat she did not understand.\n\nHe was courteous always, but aloof, remote.  No one could ever\ntell what he was thinking about, Scarlett least of all.  In a\nneighborhood where everyone said exactly what he thought as soon\nas he thought it, Ashley's quality of reserve was exasperating.\nHe was as proficient as any of the other young men in the usual\nCounty diversions, hunting, gambling, dancing and politics, and\nwas the best rider of them all; but he differed from all the rest\nin that these pleasant activities were not the end and aim of life\nto him.  And he stood alone in his interest in books and music and\nhis fondness for writing poetry.\n\nOh, why was he so handsomely blond, so courteously aloof, so\nmaddeningly boring with his talk about Europe and books and music\nand poetry and things that interested her not at all--and yet so\ndesirable?  Night after night, when Scarlett went to bed after\nsitting on the front porch in the semi-darkness with him, she\ntossed restlessly for hours and comforted herself only with the\nthought that the very next time he saw her he certainly would\npropose.  But the next time came and went, and the result was\nnothing--nothing except that the fever possessing her rose higher\nand hotter.\n\nShe loved him and she wanted him and she did not understand him.\nShe was as forthright and simple as the winds that blew over Tara\nand the yellow river that wound about it, and to the end of her\ndays she would never be able to understand a complexity.  And now,\nfor the first time in her life, she was facing a complex nature.\n\nFor Ashley was born of a line of men who used their leisure for\nthinking, not doing, for spinning brightly colored dreams that had\nin them no touch of reality.  He moved in an inner world that was\nmore beautiful than Georgia and came back to reality with\nreluctance.  He looked on people, and he neither liked nor\ndisliked them.  He looked on life and was neither heartened nor\nsaddened.  He accepted the universe and his place in it for what\nthey were and, shrugging, turned to his music and books and his\nbetter world.\n\nWhy he should have captivated Scarlett when his mind was a\nstranger to hers she did not know.  The very mystery of him\nexcited her curiosity like a door that had neither lock nor key.\nThe things about him which she could not understand only made her\nlove him more, and his odd, restrained courtship only served to\nincrease her determination to have him for her own.  That he would\npropose some day she had never doubted, for she was too young and\ntoo spoiled ever to have known defeat.  And now, like a thunderclap,\nhad come this horrible news.  Ashley to marry Melanie!  It couldn't\nbe true!\n\nWhy, only last week, when they were riding home at twilight from\nFairhill, he had said:  \"Scarlett, I have something so important\nto tell you that I hardly know how to say it.\"\n\nShe had cast down her eyes demurely, her heart beating with wild\npleasure, thinking the happy moment had come.  Then he had said:\n\"Not now!  We're nearly home and there isn't time.  Oh, Scarlett,\nwhat a coward I am!\"  And putting spurs to his horse, he had raced\nher up the hill to Tara.\n\nScarlett, sitting on the stump, thought of those words which had\nmade her so happy, and suddenly they took on another meaning, a\nhideous meaning.  Suppose it was the news of his engagement he had\nintended to tell her!\n\nOh, if Pa would only come home!  She could not endure the suspense\nanother moment.  She looked impatiently down the road again, and\nagain she was disappointed.\n\nThe sun was now below the horizon and the red glow at the rim of\nthe world faded into pink.  The sky above turned slowly from azure\nto the delicate blue-green of a robin's egg, and the unearthly\nstillness of rural twilight came stealthily down about her.\nShadowy dimness crept over the countryside.  The red furrows and\nthe gashed red road lost their magical blood color and became\nplain brown earth.  Across the road, in the pasture, the horses,\nmules and cows stood quietly with heads over the split-rail fence,\nwaiting to be driven to the stables and supper.  They did not like\nthe dark shade of the thickets hedging the pasture creek, and they\ntwitched their ears at Scarlett as if appreciative of human\ncompanionship.\n\nIn the strange half-light, the tall pines of the river swamp, so\nwarmly green in the sunshine, were black against the pastel sky,\nan impenetrable row of black giants hiding the slow yellow water\nat their feet.  On the hill across the river, the tall white\nchimneys of the Wilkes' home faded gradually into the darkness of\nthe thick oaks surrounding them, and only far-off pin points of\nsupper lamps showed that a house was here.  The warm damp\nbalminess of spring encompassed her sweetly with the moist smells\nof new-plowed earth and all the fresh green things pushing up to\nthe air.\n\nSunset and spring and new-fledged greenery were no miracle to\nScarlett.  Their beauty she accepted as casually as the air she\nbreathed and the water she drank, for she had never consciously\nseen beauty in anything but women's faces, horses, silk dresses\nand like tangible things.

    "paragraph": " Yet the serene half-light over Tara's\nwell-kept acres brought a measure of quiet to her disturbed mind.\nShe loved this land so much, without even knowing she loved it,\nloved it as she loved her mother's face under the lamp at prayer\ntime.\n\nStill there was no sign of Gerald on the quiet winding road.  If\nshe had to wait much longer, Mammy would certainly come in search\nof her and bully her into the house.  But even as she strained her\neyes down the darkening road, she heard a pounding of hooves at\nthe bottom of the pasture hill and saw the horses and cows scatter\nin fright.  Gerald O'Hara was coming home across country and at\ntop speed.\n\nHe came up the hill at a gallop on his thick-barreled, long-legged\nhunter, appearing in the distance like a boy on a too large horse.\nHis long white hair standing out behind him, he urged the horse\nforward with crop and loud cries.\n\nFilled with her own anxieties, she nevertheless watched him with\naffectionate pride, for Gerald was an excellent horseman.\n\n\"I wonder why he always wants to jump fences when he's had a few\ndrinks,\" she thought.  \"And after that fall he had right here last\nyear when he broke his knee.  You'd think he'd learn.  Especially\nwhen he promised Mother on oath he'd never jump again.\"\n\nScarlett had no awe of her father and felt him more her contemporary\nthan her sisters, for jumping fences and keeping it a secret from\nhis wife gave him a boyish pride and guilty glee that matched her\nown pleasure in outwitting Mammy.  She rose from her seat to watch\nhim.\n\nThe big horse reached the fence, gathered himself and soared over\nas effortlessly as a bird, his rider yelling enthusiastically, his\ncrop beating the air, his white curls jerking out behind him.\nGerald did not see his daughter in the shadow of the trees, and he\ndrew rein in the road, patting his horse's neck with approbation.\n\n\"There's none in the County can touch you, nor in the state,\" he\ninformed his mount, with pride, the brogue of County Meath still\nheavy on his tongue in spite of thirty-nine years in America.\nThen he hastily set about smoothing his hair and settling his\nruffled shirt and his cravat which had slipped awry behind one\near.  Scarlett knew these hurried preenings were being made with\nan eye toward meeting his wife with the appearance of a gentleman\nwho had ridden sedately home from a call on a neighbor.  She knew\nalso that he was presenting her with just the opportunity she\nwanted for opening the conversation without revealing her true\npurpose.\n\nShe laughed aloud.  As she had intended, Gerald was startled by\nthe sound; then he recognized her, and a look both sheepish and\ndefiant came over his florid face.  He dismounted with difficulty,\nbecause his knee was stiff, and, slipping the reins over his arm,\nstumped toward her.\n\n\"Well, Missy,\" he said, pinching her cheek, \"so, you've been\nspying on me and, like your sister Suellen last week, you'll be\ntelling your mother on me?\"\n\nThere was indignation in his hoarse bass voice but also a\nwheedling note, and Scarlett teasingly clicked her tongue against\nher teeth as she reached out to pull his cravat into place.  His\nbreath in her face was strong with Bourbon whisky mingled with a\nfaint fragrance of mint.  Accompanying him also were the smells of\nchewing tobacco, well-oiled leather and horses--a combination of\nodors that she always associated with her father and instinctively\nliked in other men.\n\n\"No, Pa, I'm no tattletale like Suellen,\" she assured him,\nstanding off to view his rearranged attire with a judicious air.\n\nGerald was a small man, little more than five feet tall, but so\nheavy of barrel and thick of neck that his appearance, when\nseated, led strangers to think him a larger man.  His thickset\ntorso was supported by short sturdy legs, always incased in the\nfinest leather boots procurable and always planted wide apart like\na swaggering small boy's.  Most small people who take themselves\nseriously are a little ridiculous; but the bantam cock is\nrespected in the barnyard, and so it was with Gerald.  No one\nwould ever have the temerity to think of Gerald O'Hara as a\nridiculous little figure.\n\nHe was sixty years old and his crisp curly hair was silver-white,\nbut his shrewd face was unlined and his hard little blue eyes were\nyoung with the unworried youthfulness of one who has never taxed\nhis brain with problems more abstract than how many cards to draw\nin a poker game.  His was as Irish a face as could be found in the\nlength and breadth of the homeland he had left so long ago--round,\nhigh colored, short nosed, wide mouthed and belligerent.\n\nBeneath his choleric exterior Gerald O'Hara had the tenderest of\nhearts.  He could not bear to see a slave pouting under a\nreprimand, no matter how well deserved, or hear a kitten mewing or\na child crying; but he had a horror of having this weakness\ndiscovered.  That everyone who met him did discover his kindly\nheart within five minutes was unknown to him; and his vanity would\nhave suffered tremendously if he had found it out, for he liked to\nthink that when he bawled orders at the top of his voice everyone\ntrembled and obeyed.  It had never occurred to him that only one\nvoice was obeyed on the plantation--the soft voice of his wife\nEllen.  It was a secret he would never learn, for everyone from\nEllen down to the stupidest field hand was in a tacit and kindly\nconspiracy to keep him believing that his word was law.\n\nScarlett was impressed less than anyone else by his tempers and\nhis roarings.  She was his oldest child and, now that Gerald knew\nthere would be no more sons to follow the three who lay in the\nfamily burying ground, he had drifted into a habit of treating her\nin a man-to-man manner which she found most pleasant.  She was\nmore like her father than her younger sisters, for Carreen, who\nhad been born Caroline Irene, was delicate and dreamy, and\nSuellen, christened Susan Elinor, prided herself on her elegance\nand ladylike deportment.\n\nMoreover, Scarlett and her father were bound together by a mutual\nsuppression agreement.  If Gerald caught her climbing a fence\ninstead of walking half a mile to a gate, or sitting too late on\nthe front steps with a beau, he castigated her personally and with\nvehemence, but he did not mention the fact to Ellen or to Mammy.\nAnd when Scarlett discovered him jumping fences after his solemn\npromise to his wife, or learned the exact amount of his losses at\npoker, as she always did from County gossip, she refrained from\nmentioning the fact at the supper table in the artfully artless\nmanner Suellen had.  Scarlett and her father each assured the\nother solemnly that to bring such matters to the ears of Ellen\nwould only hurt her, and nothing would induce them to wound her\ngentleness.\n\nScarlett looked at her father in the fading light, and, without\nknowing why, she found it comforting to be in his presence.  There\nwas something vital and earthy and coarse about him that appealed\nto her.  Being the least analytic of people, she did not realize\nthat this was because she possessed in some degree these same\nqualities, despite sixteen years of effort on the part of Ellen\nand Mammy to obliterate them.\n\n\"You look very presentable now,\" she said, \"and I don't think\nanyone will suspect you've been up to your tricks unless you brag\nabout them.  But it does seem to me that after you broke your knee\nlast year, jumping that same fence--\"\n\n\"Well, may I be damned if I'll have me own daughter telling me\nwhat I shall jump and not jump,\" he shouted, giving her cheek\nanother pinch.  \"It's me own neck, so it is.  And besides, Missy,\nwhat are you doing out here without your shawl?\"\n\nSeeing that he was employing familiar maneuvers to extricate\nhimself from unpleasant conversation, she slipped her arm through\nhis and said:  \"I was waiting for you.  I didn't know you would be\nso late.  I just wondered if you had bought Dilcey.\"\n\n\"Bought her I did, and the price has ruined me.  Bought her and\nher little wench, Prissy.  John Wilkes was for almost giving them\naway, but never will I have it said that Gerald O'Hara used\nfriendship in a trade.  I made him take three thousand for the two\nof them.\"\n\n\"In the name of Heaven, Pa, three thousand!  And you didn't need\nto buy Prissy!\"\n\n\"Has the time come when me own daughters sit in judgment on me?\"\nshouted Gerald rhetorically.  \"Prissy is a likely little wench and\nso--\"\n\n\"I know her.  She's a sly, stupid creature,\" Scarlett rejoined\ncalmly, unimpressed by his uproar.  \"And the only reason you\nbought her was because Dilcey asked you to buy her.\"\n\nGerald looked crestfallen and embarrassed, as always when caught\nin a kind deed, and Scarlett laughed outright at his transparency.\n\n\"Well, what if I did?  Was there any use buying Dilcey if she was\ngoing to mope about the child?  Well, never again will I let a\ndarky on this place marry off it.  It's too expensive.  Well, come\non, Puss, let's go in to supper.\"\n\nThe shadows were falling thicker now, the last greenish tinge had\nleft the sky and a slight chill was displacing the balminess of\nspring.  But Scarlett loitered, wondering how to bring up the\nsubject of Ashley without permitting Gerald to suspect her motive.\nThis was difficult, for Scarlett had not a subtle bone in her\nbody; and Gerald was so much like her he never failed to penetrate\nher weak subterfuges, even as she penetrated his.  And he was\nseldom tactful in doing it.\n\n\"How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?\"\n\n\"About as usual.  Cade Calvert was there and, after I settled\nabout Dilcey, we all set on the gallery and had several toddies.\nCade has just come from Atlanta, and it's all upset they are there\nand talking war and--\"\n\nScarlett sighed.  If Gerald once got on the subject of war and\nsecession, it would be hours before he relinquished it.  She broke\nin with another line.\n\n\"Did they say anything about the barbecue tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Now that I think of it they did.  Miss--what's-her-name--the\nsweet little thing who was here last year, you know, Ashley's\ncousin--oh, yes, Miss Melanie Hamilton, that's the name--she and\nher brother Charles have already come from Atlanta and--\"\n\n\"Oh, so she did come?\"\n\n\"She did, and a sweet quiet thing she is, with never a word to say\nfor herself, like a woman should be.  Come now, daughter, don't\nlag.  Your mother will be hunting for us.\"\n\nScarlett's heart sank at the news.  She had hoped against hope\nthat something would keep Melanie Hamilton in Atlanta where she\nbelonged, and the knowledge that even her father approved of her\nsweet quiet nature, so different from her own, forced her into the\nopen.\n\n\"Was Ashley there, too?\"\n\n\"He was.\"  Gerald let go of his daughter's arm and turned, peering\nsharply into her face.  \"And if that's why you came out here to\nwait for me, why didn't you say so without beating around the\nbush?\"\n\nScarlett could think of nothing to say, and she felt her face\ngrowing red with annoyance.\n\n\"Well, speak up.\"\n\nStill she said nothing, wishing that it was permissible to shake\none's father and tell him to hush his mouth.\n\n\"He was there and he asked most kindly after you, as did his\nsisters, and said they hoped nothing would keep you from the\nbarbecue tomorrow.  I'll warrant nothing will,\" he said shrewdly.\n\"And now, daughter, what's all this about you and Ashley?\"\n\n\"There is nothing,\" she said shortly, tugging at his arm.  \"Let's\ngo in, Pa.\"\n\n\"So now 'tis you wanting to go in,\" he observed.  \"But here I'm\ngoing to stand till I'm understanding you.  Now that I think of\nit, 'tis strange you've been recently.  Has he been trifling with\nyou?  Has he asked to marry you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said shortly.\n\n\"Nor will he,\" said Gerald.\n\nFury flamed in her, but Gerald waved her quiet with a hand.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Miss!  I had it from John Wilkes this afternoon\nin the strictest confidence that Ashley's to marry Miss Melanie.\nIt's to be announced tomorrow.\"\n\nScarlett's hand fell from his arm. ",

    "paragraph": " So it was true!\n\nA pain slashed at her heart as savagely as a wild animal's fangs.\nThrough it all, she felt her father's eyes on her, a little\npitying, a little annoyed at being faced with a problem for which\nhe knew no answer.  He loved Scarlett, but it made him uncomfortable\nto have her forcing her childish problems on him for a solution.\nEllen knew all the answers.  Scarlett should have taken her troubles\nto her.\n\n\"Is it a spectacle you've been making of yourself--of all of us?\"\nhe bawled, his voice rising as always in moments of excitement.\n\"Have you been running after a man who's not in love with you,\nwhen you could have any of the bucks in the County?\"\n\nAnger and hurt pride drove out some of the pain.\n\n\"I haven't been running after him.  It--it just surprised me.\"\n\n\"It's lying you are!\" said Gerald, and then, peering at her\nstricken face, he added in a burst of kindliness:  \"I'm sorry,\ndaughter.  But after all, you are nothing but a child and there's\nlots of other beaux.\"\n\n\"Mother was only fifteen when she married you, and I'm sixteen,\"\nsaid Scarlett, her voice muffled.\n\n\"Your mother was different,\" said Gerald.  \"She was never flighty\nlike you.  Now come, daughter, cheer up, and I'll take you to\nCharleston next week to visit your Aunt Eulalie and, what with all\nthe hullabaloo they are having over there about Fort Sumter,\nyou'll be forgetting about Ashley in a week.\"\n\n\"He thinks I'm a child,\" thought Scarlett, grief and anger choking\nutterance, \"and he's only got to dangle a new toy and I'll forget\nmy bumps.\"\n\n\"Now, don't be jerking your chin at me,\" warned Gerald.  \"If you\nhad any sense you'd have married Stuart or Brent Tarleton long\nago.  Think it over, daughter.  Marry one of the twins and then\nthe plantations will run together and Jim Tarleton and I will\nbuild you a fine house, right where they join, in that big pine\ngrove and--\"\n\n\"Will you stop treating me like a child!\" cried Scarlett.  \"I\ndon't want to go to Charleston or have a house or marry the twins.\nI only want--\"  She caught herself but not in time.\n\nGerald's voice was strangely quiet and he spoke slowly as if\ndrawing his words from a store of thought seldom used.\n\n\"It's only Ashley you're wanting, and you'll not be having him.\nAnd if he wanted to marry you, 'twould be with misgivings that I'd\nsay Yes, for all the fine friendship that's between me and John\nWilkes.\"  And, seeing her startled look, he continued:  \"I want my\ngirl to be happy and you wouldn't be happy with him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I would!  I would!\"\n\n\"That you would not, daughter.  Only when like marries like can\nthere be any happiness.\"\n\nScarlett had a sudden treacherous desire to cry out, \"But you've\nbeen happy, and you and Mother aren't alike,\" but she repressed\nit, fearing that he would box her ears for her impertinence.\n\n\"Our people and the Wilkes are different,\" he went on slowly,\nfumbling for words.  \"The Wilkes are different from any of our\nneighbors--different from any family I ever knew.  They are queer\nfolk, and it's best that they marry their cousins and keep their\nqueerness to themselves.\"\n\n\"Why, Pa, Ashley is not--\"\n\n\"Hold your whist, Puss!  I said nothing against the lad, for I\nlike him.  And when I say queer, it's not crazy I'm meaning.  He's\nnot queer like the Calverts who'd gamble everything they have on a\nhorse, or the Tarletons who turn out a drunkard or two in every\nlitter, or the Fontaines who are hot-headed little brutes and\nafter murdering a man for a fancied slight.  That kind of\nqueerness is easy to understand, for sure, and but for the grace\nof God Gerald O'Hara would be having all those faults!  And I\ndon't mean that Ashley would run off with another woman, if you\nwere his wife, or beat you.  You'd be happier if he did, for at\nleast you'd be understanding that.  But he's queer in other ways,\nand there's no understanding him at all.  I like him, but it's\nneither heads nor tails I can make of most he says.  Now, Puss,\ntell me true, do you understand his folderol about books and\npoetry and music and oil paintings and such foolishness?\"\n\n\"Oh, Pa,\" cried Scarlett impatiently, \"if I married him, I'd\nchange all that!\"\n\n\"Oh, you would, would you now?\" said Gerald testily, shooting a\nsharp look at her.  \"Then it's little enough you are knowing of\nany man living, let alone Ashley.  No wife has ever changed a\nhusband one whit, and don't you be forgetting that.  And as for\nchanging a Wilkes--God's nightgown, daughter!  The whole family is\nthat way, and they've always been that way.  And probably always\nwill.  I tell you they're born queer.  Look at the way they go\ntearing up to New York and Boston to hear operas and see oil\npaintings.  And ordering French and German books by the crate from\nthe Yankees!  And there they sit reading and dreaming the dear God\nknows what, when they'd be better spending their time hunting and\nplaying poker as proper men should.\"\n\n\"There's nobody in the County sits a horse better than Ashley,\"\nsaid Scarlett, furious at the slur of effeminacy flung on Ashley,\n\"nobody except maybe his father.  And as for poker, didn't Ashley\ntake two hundred dollars away from you just last week in\nJonesboro?\"\n\n\"The Calvert boys have been blabbing again,\" Gerald said\nresignedly, \"else you'd not be knowing the amount.  Ashley can\nride with the best and play poker with the best--that's me, Puss!\nAnd I'm not denying that when he sets out to drink he can put even\nthe Tarletons under the table.  He can do all those things, but\nhis heart's not in it.  That's why I say he's queer.\"\n\nScarlett was silent and her heart sank.  She could think of no\ndefense for this last, for she knew Gerald was right.  Ashley's\nheart was in none of the pleasant things he did so well.  He was\nnever more than politely interested in any of the things that\nvitally interested every one else.\n\nRightly interpreting her silence, Gerald patted her arm and said\ntriumphantly:  \"There now, Scarlett!  You admit 'tis true.  What\nwould you be doing with a husband like Ashley?  'Tis moonstruck\nthey all are, all the Wilkes.\"  And then, in a wheedling tone:\n\"When I was mentioning the Tarletons the while ago, I wasn't\npushing them.  They're fine lads, but if it's Cade Calvert you're\nsetting your cap after, why, 'tis the same with me.  The Calverts\nare good folk, all of them, for all the old man marrying a Yankee.\nAnd when I'm gone--Whist, darlin', listen to me!  I'll leave Tara\nto you and Cade--\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have Cade on a silver tray,\" cried Scarlett in fury.\n\"And I wish you'd quit pushing him at me!  I don't want Tara or\nany old plantation.  Plantations don't amount to anything when--\"\n\nShe was going to say \"when you haven't the man you want,\" but\nGerald, incensed by the cavalier way in which she treated his\nproffered gift, the thing which, next to Ellen, he loved best in\nthe whole world uttered a roar.\n\n\"Do you stand there, Scarlett O'Hara, and tell me that Tara--that\nland--doesn't amount to anything?\"\n\nScarlett nodded obstinately.  Her heart was too sore to care\nwhether or not she put her father in a temper.\n\n\"Land is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything,\" he\nshouted, his thick, short arms making wide gestures of indignation,\n\"for 'tis the only thing in this world that lasts, and don't you be\nforgetting it!  'Tis the only thing worth working for, worth\nfighting for--worth dying for.\"\n\n\"Oh, Pa,\" she said disgustedly, \"you talk like an Irishman!\"\n\n\"Have I ever been ashamed of it?  No, 'tis proud I am.  And don't\nbe forgetting that you are half Irish, Miss!  And to anyone with a\ndrop of Irish blood in them the land they live on is like their\nmother.  'Tis ashamed of you I am this minute.  I offer you the\nmost beautiful land in the world--saving County Meath in the Old\nCountry--and what do you do?  You sniff!\"\n\nGerald had begun to work himself up into a pleasurable shouting\nrage when something in Scarlett's woebegone face stopped him.\n\n\"But there, you're young.  'Twill come to you, this love of land.\nThere's no getting away from it, if you're Irish.  You're just a\nchild and bothered about your beaux.  When you're older, you'll be\nseeing how 'tis. . . .  Now, do you be making up your mind about\nCade or the twins or one of Evan Munroe's young bucks, and see how\nfine I turn you out!\"\n\n\"Oh, Pa!\"\n\nBy this time, Gerald was thoroughly tired of the conversation and\nthoroughly annoyed that the problem should be upon his shoulders.\nHe felt aggrieved, moreover, that Scarlett should still look\ndesolate after being offered the best of the County boys and Tara,\ntoo.  Gerald liked his gifts to be received with clapping of hands\nand kisses.\n\n\"Now, none of your pouts, Miss.  It doesn't matter who you marry,\nas long as he thinks like you and is a gentleman and a Southerner\nand prideful.  For a woman, love comes after marriage.\"\n\n\"Oh, Pa, that's such an Old Country notion!\"\n\n\"And a good notion it is!  All this American business of running\naround marrying for love, like servants, like Yankees!  The best\nmarriages are when the parents choose for the girl.  For how can a\nsilly piece like yourself tell a good man from a scoundrel?  Now,\nlook at the Wilkes.  What's kept them prideful and strong all\nthese generations?  Why, marrying the likes of themselves,\nmarrying the cousins their family always expects them to marry.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Scarlett, fresh pain striking her as Gerald's words\nbrought home the terrible inevitability of the truth.\n\nGerald looked at her bowed head and shuffled his feet uneasily.\n\n\"It's not crying you are?\" he questioned, fumbling clumsily at her\nchin, trying to turn her face upward, his own face furrowed with\npity.\n\n\"No,\" she cried vehemently, jerking away.\n\n\"It's lying you are, and I'm proud of it.  I'm glad there's pride\nin you, Puss.  And I want to see pride in you tomorrow at the\nbarbecue.  I'll not be having the County gossiping and laughing at\nyou for mooning your heart out about a man who never gave you a\nthought beyond friendship.\"\n\n\"He did give me a thought,\" thought Scarlett, sorrowfully in her\nheart.  \"Oh, a lot of thoughts!  I know he did.  I could tell.  If\nI'd just had a little longer, I know I could have made him say--\nOh, if it only wasn't that the Wilkes always feel that they have\nto marry their cousins!\"\n\nGerald took her arm and passed it through his.\n\n\"We'll be going in to supper now, and all this is between us.\nI'll not be worrying your mother with this--nor do you do it\neither.  Blow your nose, daughter.\"\n\nScarlett blew her nose on her torn handkerchief, and they started\nup the dark drive arm in arm, the horse following slowly.  Near\nthe house, Scarlett was at the point of speaking again when she\nsaw her mother in the dim shadows of the porch.  She had on her\nbonnet, shawl and mittens, and behind her was Mammy, her face like\na thundercloud, holding in her hand the black leather bag in which\nEllen O'Hara always carried the bandages and medicines she used in\ndoctoring the slaves.  Mammy's lips were large and pendulous and,\nwhen indignant, she could push out her lower one to twice its\nnormal length.  It was pushed out now, and Scarlett knew that\nMammy was seething over something of which she did not approve.\n\n\"Mr. O'Hara,\" called Ellen as she saw the two coming up the\ndriveway--Ellen belonged to a generation that was formal even\nafter seventeen years of wedlock and the bearing of six children--\n\"Mr. O'Hara, there is illness at the Slattery house.  Emmie's baby\nhas been born and is dying and must be baptized. ",

    "paragraph": " I am going there\nwith Mammy to see what I can do.\"\n\nHer voice was raised questioningly, as though she hung on Gerald's\nassent to her plan, a mere formality but one dear to the heart of\nGerald.\n\n\"In the name of God!\" blustered Gerald.  \"Why should those white\ntrash take you away just at your supper hour and just when I'm\nwanting to tell you about the war talk that's going on in Atlanta!\nGo, Mrs. O'Hara.  You'd not rest easy on your pillow the night if\nthere was trouble abroad and you not there to help.\"\n\n\"She doan never git no res' on her piller fer hoppin' up at night\ntime nursin' niggers an po' w'ite trash dat could ten' to\ndeyseff,\" grumbled Mammy in a monotone as she went down the stairs\ntoward the carriage which was waiting in the side drive.\n\n\"Take my place at the table, dear,\" said Ellen, patting Scarlett's\ncheek softly with a mittened hand.\n\nIn spite of her choked-back tears, Scarlett thrilled to the never-\nfailing magic of her mother's touch, to the faint fragrance of\nlemon verbena sachet that came from her rustling silk dress.  To\nScarlett, there was something breath-taking about Ellen O'Hara, a\nmiracle that lived in the house with her and awed her and charmed\nand soothed her.\n\nGerald helped his wife into the carriage and gave orders to the\ncoachman to drive carefully.  Toby, who had handled Gerald's\nhorses for twenty years, pushed out his lips in mute indignation\nat being told how to conduct his own business.  Driving off, with\nMammy beside him, each was a perfect picture of pouting African\ndisapproval.\n\n\"If I didn't do so much for those trashy Slatterys that they'd\nhave to pay money for elsewhere,\" fumed Gerald, \"they'd be willing\nto sell me their miserable few acres of swamp bottom, and the\nCounty would be well rid of them.\"  Then, brightening, in\nanticipation of one of his practical jokes:  \"Come daughter, let's\ngo tell Pork that instead of buying Dilcey, I've sold him to John\nWilkes.\"\n\nHe tossed the reins of his horse to a small pickaninny standing\nnear and started up the steps.  He had already forgotten\nScarlett's heartbreak and his mind was only on plaguing his valet.\nScarlett slowly climbed the steps after him, her feet leaden.  She\nthought that, after all, a mating between herself and Ashley could\nbe no queerer than that of her father and Ellen Robillard O'Hara.\nAs always, she wondered how her loud, insensitive father had\nmanaged to marry a woman like her mother, for never were two\npeople further apart in birth, breeding and habits of mind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nEllen O'Hara was thirty-two years old, and, according to the\nstandards of her day, she was a middle-aged woman, one who had\nborne six children and buried three.  She was a tall woman,\nstanding a head higher than her fiery little husband, but she\nmoved with such quiet grace in her swaying hoops that the height\nattracted no attention to itself.  Her neck, rising from the black\ntaffeta sheath of her basque, was creamy-skinned, rounded and\nslender, and it seemed always tilted slightly backward by the\nweight of her luxuriant hair in its net at the back of her head.\nFrom her French mother, whose parents had fled Haiti in the\nRevolution of 1791, had come her slanting dark eyes, shadowed by\ninky lashes, and her black hair; and from her father, a soldier of\nNapoleon, she had her long straight nose and her square-cut jaw\nthat was softened by the gentle curving of her cheeks.  But only\nfrom life could Ellen's face have acquired its look of pride that\nhad no haughtiness, its graciousness, its melancholy and its utter\nlack of humor.\n\nShe would have been a strikingly beautiful woman had there been\nany glow in her eyes, any responsive warmth in her smile or any\nspontaneity in her voice that fell with gentle melody on the ears\nof her family and her servants.  She spoke in the soft slurring\nvoice of the coastal Georgian, liquid of vowels, kind to\nconsonants and with the barest trace of French accent.  It was a\nvoice never raised in command to a servant or reproof to a child\nbut a voice that was obeyed instantly at Tara, where her husband's\nblustering and roaring were quietly disregarded.\n\nAs far back as Scarlett could remember, her mother had always been\nthe same, her voice soft and sweet whether in praising or in\nreproving, her manner efficient and unruffled despite the daily\nemergencies of Gerald's turbulent household, her spirit always\ncalm and her back unbowed, even in the deaths of her three baby\nsons.  Scarlett had never seen her mother's back touch the back of\nany chair on which she sat.  Nor had she ever seen her sit down\nwithout a bit of needlework in her hands, except at mealtime,\nwhile attending the sick or while working at the bookkeeping of\nthe plantation.  It was delicate embroidery if company were\npresent, but at other times her hands were occupied with Gerald's\nruffled shirts, the girls' dresses or garments for the slaves.\nScarlett could not imagine her mother's hands without her gold\nthimble or her rustling figure unaccompanied by the small negro\ngirl whose sole function in life was to remove basting threads and\ncarry the rosewood sewing box from room to room, as Ellen moved\nabout the house superintending the cooking, the cleaning and the\nwholesale clothes-making for the plantation.\n\nShe had never seen her mother stirred from her austere placidity,\nnor her personal appointments anything but perfect, no matter what\nthe hour of day or night.  When Ellen was dressing for a ball or\nfor guests or even to go to Jonesboro for Court Day, it frequently\nrequired two hours, two maids and Mammy to turn her out to her own\nsatisfaction; but her swift toilets in times of emergency were\namazing.\n\nScarlett, whose room lay across the hall from her mother's, knew\nfrom babyhood the soft sound of scurrying bare black feet on the\nhardwood floor in the hours of dawn, the urgent tappings on her\nmother's door, and the muffled, frightened negro voices that\nwhispered of sickness and birth and death in the long row of\nwhitewashed cabins in the quarters.  As a child, she often had\ncrept to the door and, peeping through the tiniest crack, had seen\nEllen emerge from the dark room, where Gerald's snores were\nrhythmic and untroubled, into the flickering light of an upheld\ncandle, her medicine case under her arm, her hair smoothed neatly\nplace, and no button on her basque unlooped.\n\nIt had always been so soothing to Scarlett to hear her mother\nwhisper, firmly but compassionately, as she tiptoed down the hall:\n\"Hush, not so loudly.  You will wake Mr. O'Hara.  They are not\nsick enough to die.\"\n\nYes, it was good to creep back into bed and know that Ellen was\nabroad in the night and everything was right.\n\nIn the mornings, after all-night sessions at births and deaths,\nwhen old Dr. Fontaine and young Dr. Fontaine were both out on\ncalls and could not be found to help her, Ellen presided at the\nbreakfast table as usual, her dark eyes circled with weariness but\nher voice and manner revealing none of the strain.  There was a\nsteely quality under her stately gentleness that awed the whole\nhousehold, Gerald as well as the girls, though he would have died\nrather than admit it.\n\nSometimes when Scarlett tiptoed at night to kiss her tall mother's\ncheek, she looked up at the mouth with its too short, too tender\nupper lip, a mouth too easily hurt by the world, and wondered if\nit had ever curved in silly girlish giggling or whispered secrets\nthrough long nights to intimate girl friends.  But no, that wasn't\npossible.  Mother had always been just as she was, a pillar of\nstrength, a fount of wisdom, the one person who knew the answers\nto everything.\n\nBut Scarlett was wrong, for, years before, Ellen Robillard of\nSavannah had giggled as inexplicably as any fifteen-year-old in\nthat charming coastal city and whispered the long nights through\nwith friends, exchanging confidences, telling all secrets but one.\nThat was the year when Gerald O'Hara, twenty-eight years older\nthan she, came into her life--the year, too, when youth and her\nblack-eyed cousin, Philippe Robillard, went out of it.  For when\nPhilippe, with his snapping eyes and his wild ways, left Savannah\nforever, he took with him the glow that was in Ellen's heart and\nleft for the bandy-legged little Irishman who married her only a\ngentle shell.\n\nBut that was enough for Gerald, overwhelmed at his unbelievable\nluck in actually marrying her.  And if anything was gone from her,\nhe never missed it.  Shrewd man that he was, he knew that it was\nno less than a miracle that he, an Irishman with nothing of family\nand wealth to recommend him, should win the daughter of one of the\nwealthiest and proudest families on the Coast.  For Gerald was a\nself-made man.\n\n\n\nGerald had come to America from Ireland when he was twenty-one.\nHe had come hastily, as many a better and worse Irishman before\nand since, with the clothes he had on his back, two shillings\nabove his passage money and a price on his head that he felt was\nlarger than his misdeed warranted.  There was no Orangeman this\nside of hell worth a hundred pounds to the British government or\nto the devil himself; but if the government felt so strongly about\nthe death of an English absentee landlord's rent agent, it was\ntime for Gerald O'Hara to be leaving and leaving suddenly.  True,\nhe had called the rent agent \"a bastard of an Orangeman,\" but\nthat, according to Gerald's way of looking at it, did not give the\nman any right to insult him by whistling the opening bars of \"The\nBoyne Water.\"\n\nThe Battle of the Boyne had been fought more than a hundred years\nbefore, but, to the O'Haras and their neighbors, it might have\nbeen yesterday when their hopes and their dreams, as well as their\nlands and wealth, went off in the same cloud of dust that\nenveloped a frightened and fleeing Stuart prince, leaving William\nof Orange and his hated troops with their orange cockades to cut\ndown the Irish adherents of the Stuarts.\n\nFor this and other reasons, Gerald's family was not inclined to\nview the fatal outcome of this quarrel as anything very serious,\nexcept for the fact that it was charged with serious consequences.\nFor years, the O'Haras had been in bad odor with the English\nconstabulary on account of suspected activities against the\ngovernment, and Gerald was not the first O'Hara to take his foot\nin his hand and quit Ireland between dawn and morning.  His two\noldest brothers, James and Andrew, he hardly remembered, save as\nclose-lipped youths who came and went at odd hours of the night on\nmysterious errands or disappeared for weeks at a time, to their\nmother's gnawing anxiety.  They had come to America years before,\nafter the discovery of a small arsenal of rifles buried under the\nO'Hara pigsty.  Now they were successful merchants in Savannah,\n\"though the dear God alone knows where that may be,\" as their\nmother always interpolated when mentioning the two oldest of her\nmale brood, and it was to them that young Gerald was sent.\n\nHe left home with his mother's hasty kiss on his cheek and her\nfervent Catholic blessing in his ears, and his father's parting\nadmonition, \"Remember who ye are and don't be taking nothing off\nno man.\"  His five tall brothers gave him good-by with admiring\nbut slightly patronizing smiles, for Gerald was the baby and the\nlittle one of a brawny family.\n\nHis five brothers and their father stood six feet and over and\nbroad in proportion, but little Gerald, at twenty-one, knew that\nfive feet four and a half inches was as much as the Lord in His\nwisdom was going to allow him.  It was like Gerald that he never\nwasted regrets on his lack of height and never found it an\nobstacle to his acquisition of anything he wanted.  Rather, it was\nGerald's compact smallness that made him what he was, for he had\nlearned early that little people must be hardy to survive among\nlarge ones.  And Gerald was hardy.\n\nHis tall brothers were a grim, quiet lot, in whom the family\ntradition of past glories, lost forever, rankled in unspoken hate\nand crackled out in bitter humor.  Had Gerald been brawny, he\nwould have gone the way of the other O'Haras and moved quietly and\ndarkly among the rebels against the government. ",

    "paragraph": " But Gerald was\n\"loud-mouthed and bullheaded,\" as his mother fondly phrased it,\nhair trigger of temper, quick with his fists and possessed of a\nchip on his shoulder so large as to be almost visible to the naked\neye.  He swaggered among the tall O'Haras like a strutting bantam\nin a barnyard of giant Cochin roosters, and they loved him, baited\nhim affectionately to hear him roar and hammered on him with their\nlarge fists no more than was necessary to keep a baby brother in\nhis proper place.\n\nIf the educational equipment which Gerald brought to America was\nscant, he did not even know it.  Nor would he have cared if he had\nbeen told.  His mother had taught him to read and to write a clear\nhand.  He was adept at ciphering.  And there his book knowledge\nstopped.  The only Latin he knew was the responses of the Mass and\nthe only history the manifold wrongs of Ireland.  He knew no\npoetry save that of Moore and no music except the songs of Ireland\nthat had come down through the years.  While he entertained the\nliveliest respect for those who had more book learning than he, he\nnever felt his own lack.  And what need had he of these things in\na new country where the most ignorant of bogtrotters had made\ngreat fortunes? in this country which asked only that a man be\nstrong and unafraid of work?\n\nNor did James and Andrew, who took him into their store in\nSavannah, regret his lack of education.  His clear hand, his\naccurate figures and his shrewd ability in bargaining won their\nrespect, where a knowledge of literature and a fine appreciation\nof music, had young Gerald possessed them, would have moved them\nto snorts of contempt.  America, in the early years of the\ncentury, had been kind to the Irish.  James and Andrew, who had\nbegun by hauling goods in covered wagons from Savannah to\nGeorgia's inland towns, had prospered into a store of their own,\nand Gerald prospered with them.\n\nHe liked the South, and he soon became, in his own opinion, a\nSoutherner.  There was much about the South--and Southerners--that\nhe would never comprehend: but, with the wholeheartedness that was\nhis nature, he adopted its ideas and customs, as he understood\nthem, for his own--poker and horse racing, red-hot politics and\nthe code duello, States' Rights and damnation to all Yankees,\nslavery and King Cotton, contempt for white trash and exaggerated\ncourtesy to women.  He even learned to chew tobacco.  There was no\nneed for him to acquire a good head for whisky, he had been born\nwith one.\n\nBut Gerald remained Gerald.  His habits of living and his ideas\nchanged, but his manners he would not change, even had he been\nable to change them.  He admired the drawling elegance of the\nwealthy rice and cotton planters, who rode into Savannah from\ntheir moss-hung kingdoms, mounted on thoroughbred horses and\nfollowed by the carriages of their equally elegant ladies and the\nwagons of their slaves.  But Gerald could never attain elegance.\nTheir lazy, blurred voices fell pleasantly on his ears, but his\nown brisk brogue clung to his tongue.  He liked the casual grace\nwith which they conducted affairs of importance, risking a fortune,\na plantation or a slave on the turn of a card and writing off their\nlosses with careless good humor and no more ado than when they\nscattered pennies to pickaninnies.  But Gerald had known poverty,\nand he could never learn to lose money with good humor or good\ngrace.  They were a pleasant race, these coastal Georgians, with\ntheir soft-voiced, quick rages and their charming inconsistencies,\nand Gerald liked them.  But there was a brisk and restless vitality\nabout the young Irishman, fresh from a country where winds blew wet\nand chill, where misty swamps held no fevers, that set him apart\nfrom these indolent gentlefolk of semi-tropical weather and malarial\nmarshes.\n\nFrom them he learned what he found useful, and the rest he\ndismissed.  He found poker the most useful of all Southern\ncustoms, poker and a steady head for whisky; and it was his\nnatural aptitude for cards and amber liquor that brought to Gerald\ntwo of his three most prized possessions, his valet and his\nplantation.  The other was his wife, and he could only attribute\nher to the mysterious kindness of God.\n\nThe valet, Pork by name, shining black, dignified and trained in\nall the arts of sartorial elegance, was the result of an all-night\npoker game with a planter from St. Simons Island, whose courage in\na bluff equaled Gerald's but whose head for New Orleans rum did\nnot.  Though Pork's former owner later offered to buy him back at\ntwice his value, Gerald obstinately refused, for the possession of\nhis first slave, and that slave the \"best damn valet on the\nCoast,\" was the first step upward toward his heart's desire,\nGerald wanted to be a slave owner and a landed gentleman.\n\nHis mind was made up that he was not going to spend all of his\ndays, like James and Andrew, in bargaining, or all his nights, by\ncandlelight, over long columns of figures.  He felt keenly, as his\nbrothers did not, the social stigma attached to those \"in trade.\"\nGerald wanted to be a planter.  With the deep hunger of an\nIrishman who has been a tenant on the lands his people once had\nowned and hunted, he wanted to see his own acres stretching green\nbefore his eyes.  With a ruthless singleness of purpose, he\ndesired his own house, his own plantation, his own horse, his own\nslaves.  And here in this new country, safe from the twin perils\nof the land he had left--taxation that ate up crops and barns and\nthe ever-present threat of sudden confiscation--he intended to\nhave them.  But having that ambition and bringing it to realization\nwere two different matters, he discovered as time went by.  Coastal\nGeorgia was too firmly held by an entrenched aristocracy for him\never to hope to win the place he intended to have.\n\nThen the hand of Fate and a hand of poker combined to give him the\nplantation which he afterwards called Tara, and at the same time\nmoved him out of the Coast into the upland country of north\nGeorgia.\n\nIt was in a saloon in Savannah, on a hot night in spring, when the\nchance conversation of a stranger sitting near by made Gerald\nprick up his ears.  The stranger, a native of Savannah, had just\nreturned after twelve years in the inland country.  He had been\none of the winners in the land lottery conducted by the State to\ndivide up the vast area in middle Georgia, ceded by the Indians\nthe year before Gerald came to America.  He had gone up there and\nestablished a plantation; but, now the house had burned down, he\nwas tired of the \"accursed place\" and would be most happy to get\nit off his hands.\n\nGerald, his mind never free of the thought of owning a plantation\nof his own, arranged an introduction, and his interest grew as the\nstranger told how the northern section of the state was filling up\nwith newcomers from the Carolinas and Virginia.  Gerald had lived\nin Savannah long enough to acquire a viewpoint of the Coast--that\nall of the rest of the state was backwoods, with an Indian lurking\nin every thicket.  In transacting business for O'Hara Brothers, he\nhad visited Augusta, a hundred miles up the Savannah River, and he\nhad traveled inland far enough to visit the old towns westward\nfrom that city.  He knew that section to be as well settled as the\nCoast, but from the stranger's description, his plantation was\nmore than two hundred and fifty miles inland from Savannah to the\nnorth and west, and not many miles south of the Chattahoochee\nRiver.  Gerald knew that northward beyond that stream the land was\nstill held by the Cherokees, so it was with amazement that he\nheard the stranger jeer at suggestions of trouble with the Indians\nand narrate how thriving towns were growing up and plantations\nprospering in the new country.\n\nAn hour later when the conversation began to lag, Gerald, with a\nguile that belied the wide innocence of his bright blue eyes,\nproposed a game.  As the night wore on and the drinks went round,\nthere came a time when all the others in the game laid down their\nhands and Gerald and the stranger were battling alone.  The\nstranger shoved in all his chips and followed with the deed to his\nplantation.  Gerald shoved in all his chips and laid on top of\nthem his wallet.  If the money it contained happened to belong to\nthe firm of O'Hara Brothers, Gerald's conscience was not\nsufficiently troubled to confess it before Mass the following\nmorning.  He knew what he wanted, and when Gerald wanted something\nhe gained it by taking the most direct route.  Moreover, such was\nhis faith in his destiny and four deuces that he never for a\nmoment wondered just how the money would be paid back should a\nhigher hand be laid down across the table.\n\n\"It's no bargain you're getting and I am glad not to have to pay\nmore taxes on the place,\" sighed the possessor of an \"ace full,\"\nas he called for pen and ink.  \"The big house burned a year ago\nand the fields are growing up in brush and seedling pine.  But\nit's yours.\"\n\n\"Never mix cards and whisky unless you were weaned on Irish\npoteen,\" Gerald told Pork gravely the same evening, as Pork\nassisted him to bed.  And the valet, who had begun to attempt a\nbrogue out of admiration for his new master, made requisite answer\nin a combination of Geechee and County Meath that would have\npuzzled anyone except those two alone.\n\nThe muddy Flint River, running silently between walls of pine and\nwater oak covered with tangled vines, wrapped about Gerald's new\nland like a curving arm and embraced it on two sides.  To Gerald,\nstanding on the small knoll where the house had been, this tall\nbarrier of green was as visible and pleasing an evidence of\nownership as though it were a fence that he himself had built to\nmark his own.  He stood on the blackened foundation stones of the\nburned building, looked down the long avenue of trees leading\ntoward the road and swore lustily, with a joy too deep for\nthankful prayer.  These twin lines of somber trees were his, his\nthe abandoned lawn, waist high in weeds under white-starred young\nmagnolia trees.  The uncultivated fields, studded with tiny pines\nand underbrush, that stretched their rolling red-clay surface away\ninto the distance on four sides belonged to Gerald O'Hara--were\nall his because he had an unbefuddled Irish head and the courage\nto stake everything on a hand of cards.\n\nGerald closed his eyes and, in the stillness of the unworked\nacres, he felt that he had come home.  Here under his feet would\nrise a house of whitewashed brick.  Across the road would be new\nrail fences, inclosing fat cattle and blooded horses, and the red\nearth that rolled down the hillside to the rich river bottom land\nwould gleam white as eiderdown in the sun--cotton, acres and acres\nof cotton!  The fortunes of the O'Haras would rise again.\n\nWith his own small stake, what he could borrow from his\nunenthusiastic brothers and a neat sum from mortgaging the land,\nGerald bought his first field hands and came to Tara to live in\nbachelor solitude in the four-room overseer's house, till such a\ntime as the white walls of Tara should rise.\n\nHe cleared the fields and planted cotton and borrowed more money\nfrom James and Andrew to buy more slaves.  The O'Haras were a\nclannish tribe, clinging to one another in prosperity as well as\nin adversity, not for any overweening family affection but because\nthey had learned through grim years that to survive a family must\npresent an unbroken front to the world.  They lent Gerald the\nmoney and, in the years that followed, the money came back to them\nwith interest.  Gradually the plantation widened out, as Gerald\nbought more acres lying near him, and in time the white house\nbecame a reality instead of a dream.\n\nIt was built by slave labor, a clumsy sprawling building that\ncrowned the rise of ground overlooking the green incline of\npasture land running down to the river; and it pleased Gerald\ngreatly, for, even when new, it wore a look of mellowed years.\nThe old oaks, which had seen Indians pass under their limbs,\nhugged the house closely with their great trunks and towered their\nbranches over the roof in dense shade.  The lawn, reclaimed from\nweeds, grew thick with clover and Bermuda grass, and Gerald saw to\nit that it was well kept. ",

He cleared the fields and planted cotton, and with slave labor built the sprawling white house on the rise of ground overlooking the green incline of pasture land running down to the river.

    "paragraph": " From the avenue of cedars to the row of\nwhite cabins in the slave quarters, there was an air of solidness,\nof stability and permanence about Tara, and whenever Gerald\ngalloped around the bend in the road and saw his own roof rising\nthrough green branches, his heart swelled with pride as though\neach sight of it were the first sight.\n\nHe had done it all, little, hard-headed, blustering Gerald.\n\nGerald was on excellent terms with all his neighbors in the\nCounty, except the MacIntoshes whose land adjoined his on the left\nand the Slatterys whose meager three acres stretched on his right\nalong the swamp bottoms between the river and John Wilkes'\nplantation.\n\nThe MacIntoshes were Scotch-Irish and Orangemen and, had they\npossessed all the saintly qualities of the Catholic calendar, this\nancestry would have damned them forever in Gerald's eyes.  True,\nthey had lived in Georgia for seventy years and, before that, had\nspent a generation in the Carolinas; but the first of the family\nwho set foot on American shores had come from Ulster, and that was\nenough for Gerald.\n\nThey were a close-mouthed and stiff-necked family, who kept\nstrictly to themselves and intermarried with their Carolina\nrelatives, and Gerald was not alone in disliking them, for the\nCounty people were neighborly and sociable and none too tolerant\nof anyone lacking in those same qualities.  Rumors of Abolitionist\nsympathies did not enhance the popularity of the MacIntoshes.  Old\nAngus had never manumitted a single slave and had committed the\nunpardonable social breach of selling some of his negroes to\npassing slave traders en route to the cane fields of Louisiana,\nbut the rumors persisted.\n\n\"He's an Abolitionist, no doubt,\" observed Gerald to John Wilkes.\n\"But, in an Orangeman, when a principle comes up against Scotch\ntightness, the principle fares ill.\"\n\nThe Slatterys were another affair.  Being poor white, they were\nnot even accorded the grudging respect that Angus MacIntosh's dour\nindependence wrung from neighboring families.  Old Slattery, who\nclung persistently to his few acres, in spite of repeated offers\nfrom Gerald and John Wilkes, was shiftless and whining.  His wife\nwas a snarly-haired woman, sickly and washed-out of appearance,\nthe mother of a brood of sullen and rabbity-looking children--\na brood which was increased regularly every year.  Tom Slattery\nowned no slaves, and he and his two oldest boys spasmodically\nworked their few acres of cotton, while the wife and younger\nchildren tended what was supposed to be a vegetable garden.  But,\nsomehow, the cotton always failed, and the garden, due to Mrs.\nSlattery's constant childbearing, seldom furnished enough to feed\nher flock.\n\nThe sight of Tom Slattery dawdling on his neighbors' porches,\nbegging cotton seed for planting or a side of bacon to \"tide him\nover,\" was a familiar one.  Slattery hated his neighbors with what\nlittle energy he possessed, sensing their contempt beneath their\ncourtesy, and especially did he hate \"rich folks' uppity niggers.\"\nThe house negroes of the County considered themselves superior to\nwhite trash, and their unconcealed scorn stung him, while their\nmore secure position in life stirred his envy.  By contrast with\nhis own miserable existence, they were well-fed, well-clothed and\nlooked after in sickness and old age.  They were proud of the good\nnames of their owners and, for the most part, proud to belong to\npeople who were quality, while he was despised by all.\n\nTom Slattery could have sold his farm for three times its value to\nany of the planters in the County.  They would have considered it\nmoney well spent to rid the community of an eyesore, but he was\nwell satisfied to remain and to subsist miserably on the proceeds\nof a bale of cotton a year and the charity of his neighbors.\n\nWith all the rest of the County, Gerald was on terms of amity and\nsome intimacy.  The Wilkeses, the Calverts, the Tarletons, the\nFontaines, all smiled when the small figure on the big white horse\ngalloped up their driveways, smiled and signaled for tall glasses\nin which a pony of Bourbon had been poured over a teaspoon of\nsugar and a sprig of crushed mint.  Gerald was likable, and the\nneighbors learned in time what the children, negroes and dogs\ndiscovered at first sight, that a kind heart, a ready and\nsympathetic ear and an open pocketbook lurked just behind his\nbawling voice and his truculent manner.\n\nHis arrival was always amid a bedlam of hounds barking and small\nblack children shouting as they raced to meet him, quarreling for\nthe privilege of holding his horse and squirming and grinning\nunder his good-natured insults.  The white children clamored to\nsit on his knee and be trotted, while he denounced to their elders\nthe infamy of Yankee politicians; the daughters of his friends\ntook him into their confidence about their love affairs, and the\nyouths of the neighborhood, fearful of confessing debts of honor\nupon the carpets of their fathers, found him a friend in need.\n\n\"So, you've been owning this for a month, you young rascal!\" he\nwould shout.  \"And, in God's name, why haven't you been asking me\nfor the money before this?\"\n\nHis rough manner of speech was too well known to give offense, and\nit only made the young men grin sheepishly and reply:  \"Well, sir,\nI hated to trouble you, and my father--\"\n\n\"Your father's a good man, and no denying it, but strict, and so\ntake this and let's be hearing no more of it.\"\n\nThe planters' ladies were the last to capitulate.  But, when Mrs.\nWilkes, \"a great lady and with a rare gift for silence,\" as Gerald\ncharacterized her, told her husband one evening, after Gerald's\nhorse had pounded down the driveway.  \"He has a rough tongue, but\nhe is a gentleman,\" Gerald had definitely arrived.\n\nHe did not know that he had taken nearly ten years to arrive, for\nit never occurred to him that his neighbors had eyed him askance\nat first.  In his own mind, there had never been any doubt that he\nbelonged, from the moment he first set foot on Tara.\n\nWhen Gerald was forty-three, so thickset of body and florid of\nface that he looked like a hunting squire out of a sporting print,\nit came to him that Tara, dear though it was, and the County folk,\nwith their open hearts and open houses, were not enough.  He\nwanted a wife.\n\nTara cried out for a mistress.  The fat cook, a yard negro\nelevated by necessity to the kitchen, never had the meals on time,\nand the chambermaid, formerly a field hand, let dust accumulate on\nthe furniture and never seemed to have clean linen on hand, so\nthat the arrival of guests was always the occasion of much\nstirring and to-do.  Pork, the only trained house negro on the\nplace, had general supervision over the other servants, but even\nhe had grown slack and careless after several years of exposure to\nGerald's happy-go-lucky mode of living.  As valet, he kept\nGerald's bedroom in order, and, as butler, he served the meals\nwith dignity and style, but otherwise he pretty well let matters\nfollow their own course.\n\nWith unerring African instinct, the negroes had all discovered\nthat Gerald had a loud bark and no bite at all, and they took\nshameless advantage of him.  The air was always thick with threats\nof selling slaves south and of direful whippings, but there never\nhad been a slave sold from Tara and only one whipping, and that\nadministered for not grooming down Gerald's pet horse after a long\nday's hunting.\n\nGerald's sharp blue eyes noticed how efficiently his neighbors'\nhouses were run and with what ease the smooth-haired wives in\nrustling skirts managed their servants.  He had no knowledge of\nthe dawn-till-midnight activities of these women, chained to\nsupervision of cooking, nursing, sewing and laundering.  He only\nsaw the outward results, and those results impressed him.\n\nThe urgent need of a wife became clear to him one morning when he\nwas dressing to ride to town for Court Day.  Pork brought forth\nhis favorite ruffled shirt, so inexpertly mended by the\nchambermaid as to be unwearable by anyone except his valet.\n\n\"Mist' Gerald,\" said Pork, gratefully rolling up the shirt as\nGerald fumed, \"whut you needs is a wife, and a wife whut has got\nplen'y of house niggers.\"\n\nGerald upbraided Pork for his impertinence, but he knew that he\nwas right.  He wanted a wife and he wanted children and, if he did\nnot acquire them soon, it would be too late.  But he was not going\nto marry just anyone, as Mr. Calvert had done, taking to wife the\nYankee governess of his motherless children.  His wife must be a\nlady and a lady of blood, with as many airs and graces as Mrs.\nWilkes and the ability to manage Tara as well as Mrs. Wilkes\nordered her own domain.\n\nBut there were two difficulties in the way of marriage into the\nCounty families.  The first was the scarcity of girls of\nmarriageable age.  The second, and more serious one, was that\nGerald was a \"new man,\" despite his nearly ten years' residence,\nand a foreigner.  No one knew anything about his family.  While\nthe society of up-country Georgia was not so impregnable as that\nof the Coast aristocrats, no family wanted a daughter to wed a man\nabout whose grandfather nothing was known.\n\nGerald knew that despite the genuine liking of the County men with\nwhom he hunted, drank and talked politics there was hardly one\nwhose daughter he could marry.  And he did not intend to have it\ngossiped about over supper tables that this, that or the other\nfather had regretfully refused to let Gerald O'Hara pay court to\nhis daughter.  This knowledge did not make Gerald feel inferior to\nhis neighbors.  Nothing could ever make Gerald feel that he was\ninferior in any way to anyone.  It was merely a quaint custom of\nthe County that daughters only married into families who had lived\nin the South much longer than twenty-two years, had owned land and\nslaves and been addicted only to the fashionable vices during that\ntime.\n\n\"Pack up.  We're going to Savannah,\" he told Pork.  \"And if I hear\nyou say 'Whist!' or 'Faith!' but once, it's selling you I'll be\ndoing, for they are words I seldom say meself.\"\n\nJames and Andrew might have some advice to offer on this subject\nof marriage, and there might be daughters among their old friends\nwho would both meet his requirements and find him acceptable as a\nhusband.  James and Andrew listened to his story patiently but\nthey gave him little encouragement.  They had no Savannah\nrelatives to whom they might look for assistance, for they had\nbeen married when they came to America.  And the daughters of\ntheir old friends had long since married and were raising small\nchildren of their own.\n\n\"You're not a rich man and you haven't a great family,\" said\nJames.\n\n\"I've made me money and I can make a great family.  And I won't be\nmarrying just anyone.\"\n\n\"You fly high,\" observed Andrew, dryly.\n\nBut they did their best for Gerald.  James and Andrew were old men\nand they stood well in Savannah.  They had many friends, and for a\nmonth they carried Gerald from home to home, to suppers, dances\nand picnics.\n\n\"There's only one who takes me eye,\" Gerald said finally.  \"And\nshe not even born when I landed here.\"\n\n\"And who is it takes your eye?\"\n\n\"Miss Ellen Robillard,\" said Gerald, trying to speak casually, for\nthe slightly tilting dark eyes of Ellen Robillard had taken more\nthan his eye.  Despite a mystifying listlessness of manner, so\nstrange in a girl of fifteen, she charmed him.  Moreover, there\nwas a haunting look of despair about her that went to his heart\nand made him more gentle with her than he had ever been with any\nperson in all the world.\n\n\"And you old enough to be her father!\"\n\n\"And me in me prime!\" cried Gerald stung.\n\nJames spoke gently.\n\n\"Jerry, there's no girl in Savannah you'd have less chance of\nmarrying.  Her father is a Robillard, and those French are proud\nas Lucifer.  And her mother--God rest her soul--was a very great\nlady.\"\n\n\"I care not,\" said Gerald heatedly.  \"Besides, her mother is dead,\nand old man Robillard likes me.\"\n\n\"As a man, yes, but as a son-in-law, no.\"\n\n\"The girl wouldn't have you anyway,\" interposed Andrew.
