Additionally, SVM can be used to optimize the performance of renewable energy systems, such as predicting the output of a solar panel or wind turbine, thereby enhancing their efficiency and reducing their costs. Moreover, SVM can be used to classify different types of renewable energy sources, such as distinguishing between different types of biomass or identifying the source of geothermal energy. Therefore, there are numerous opportunities for SVM and machine learning to intersect with renewable energy and contribute to sustainable development.
